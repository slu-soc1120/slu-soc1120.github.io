We're once again facing a semester dramatically altered by our public health situation, though with both more risk (in the form of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19) and more hope (in the form of vaccines). Like last semester, this means we are starting another semester with what feel like novel questions. Will social distancing requirements be relaxed at any point before May? When will we be able to get vaccinated? What happens if we get sick before we can get a shot? If this is your first semester at SLU, you probably have even more questions about starting at a new institution in the middle of a pandemic.

Unlike last semester, I think we're starting this semester in an even more challenging position. As I write this, it's been over ten months now since we began practicing physical distancing and limiting activities in places outside of our home. Speaking for myself, I think I'm more tired than I've been. Each month that passes means I've spent more time without seeing friends, more time worrying, and more time holding off on doing things I love like traveling. For these reasons, I'm anticipating that this will be the most difficult semester yet.

I suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the spring of 1919 had similar questions and concerns. I think it is worth remembering, though, that SLU turned 100 years old the year that pandemic started. Despite the 1918 flu pandemic, we're still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we'll get through this, just like the classes of 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923 did.

My goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our "new normal." I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your Spring semesters.

## Focusing on What Matters
First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we'll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them? 

In March, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we did not get sick last spring, and we got to see our families this past summer and fall. We are lucky in that respect. For some of you, you may have experienced quarantining in the Fall because you were exposed to someone who was ill. Perhaps you even became ill yourselves. All of this likely increases the stress of this semester - I know many of my students are anxious to avoid quarantine housing again.

On top of all this, we have new concerns, like being back in St. Louis away from our families again, and what 2021 will bring with new variants of COVID and vaccination. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.

**All of this takes precedence over a semester's worth of college classes.** I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are "normal." We can't ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it's just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don't acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.

## Practice Self Care
The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - mostly running outdoors when it is nice and cycling indoors when the weather isn't great. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I'm home. I try to make time to read for pleasure. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day. 

Some of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/slu.edu/covid-19fall2020preparationmod/home/part-four-encouragement-and-support" target = "_blank">Return to Campus Module</a> provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use.

## What Class Will Be Like
Both of my classes will meet "synchronously." This means we have an assigned meeting time, and we'll gather twice a week. Instead of meeting in Morrissey Hall, though, we'll be meeting virtually using a tool called Zoom. Zoom will allow us to get exposed to course content, meet in small groups, and ask questions. It isn't the same, of course, but I am going to do my best to make sure you get as much of the course experience that you would ordinarily receive as I can give you. 

My decision to teach synchronously was made after reflecting on last spring, taking a class on online teaching, and then teaching synchronously this Fall. My Spring semester students overwhelmingly suggested to me that I teach synchronously, and I take feedback from students seriously. I asked my students from this past Fall the same question, and again they overwhelmingly suggested that the course should be taught synchronously.

Details about assignments and readings soon in the <a href = "https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus/" target = "_blank">syllabus</a>, but I wanted to give you all a quick preview of what the class materials will be like. Readings for the semester will come from one of three places:

  1. First, I am using a website called <a href = "https://www.sociologyexperiment.com" target = "_blank">A Sociology Experiment</a> instead of a regular text book. Chapters are written by leading sociologists, and cost $1 each. You'll only pay for the chapters you need. I know that the pandemic has created financial uncertainty for many of us, and providing you excellent resources for the lowest cost possible is important to me. 
  2. You'll also need to purchase a copy of <a href = "https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo37936174.html" target = "_blank">*Mama Might Be Better Off Dead*</a>, which retails for around $20 and is available at all the usual places you can buy books.
  3. I'll also share some readings and documentaries that you can access for free using the Library, even if you are off-campus like I am.
  
We'll be using Blackboard to access my slides and notes for each lecture, submit assignments, and take one of the three quizzes that will happen this semester. You'll take these outside of class, and have a 15 hour period of time to take each of them (from 7:00 AM CST until 10:00 PM CST). Once you start, you'll have 45 minutes to complete the 30 multiple choice questions. These quizzes aren't cumulative, and make up just over 25% of your final grade.

Most of your points this semester will therefore come from some short assignments that ask you to reflect on how sociological concepts have shaped your life ("Sociological Experiences"), create research questions based on social theory ("Theory Isn't Dead Posts"), and reflect on the content of *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead* ("QHQ Papers"). Rubrics and examples will be shared via our Blackboard site for each of these assignments.

I also expect that you will come to class. The syllabus contains all the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can't attend classes occasionally, no worries. Recordings will be made available via Blackboard. That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. I keep track not just of who attends class, but also who is present for these interactive sessions, so I will notice if you come to class, sign-in, and leave. There will be a participation grade (just over 16% of your final grade) that reflects these interactive aspects of class.

## What Happens If I Get Sick?
If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you're sick but not *very* sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.

<br>

## What Office Hours Will Be Like
My office hours are for you! I don't plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It's going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you've never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.

Just like class, office hours will occur over Zoom as well. There will be two periods:

  1. 9am-10am (by appointment only)
  2. 10am-10:45am (open)

For the appointment only period, you will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you'll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information. For the open, drop-in period, you'll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a "waiting room." I'll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately.

<br>

## Provisos
This is my plan as of January 25th, 2021. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Blackboard regularly. I appreciate everyone's willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.
