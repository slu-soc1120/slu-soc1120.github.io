It's hard to believe, but we're facing our fourth semester dramatically altered by our public health situation. In early May, it felt like this fall might be "normal" - widespread vaccination at SLU would mean we could have class, go to the dining hall, go to Chaifetz Arena, and hang out with friends like SLU students were able to do in the Fall 2020. The last three months in Missouri and elsewhere in the United States have shown us that we cannot expect a "normal" semester. We simultaneously have more risk (in the form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's Delta variant, which spreads more efficiently than other forms of SARS-CoV-2) and more hope (almost everyone on campus is vaccinated and boosters are on the way for the most vulnerable members of our community). 

All of this raises more novel questions for us to confront. Will indoor mask requirements be relaxed at any point before December? When will we be able to get booster shots? What happens if we get a breakthrough case? If this is your first semester at SLU, you probably have even more questions about starting at a new institution in the middle of a pandemic.

In some ways, I think we're starting this semester in an even more challenging position. As I write this, it's been over seventeen months now since we began practicing physical distancing and limiting activities in places outside of our home. Speaking for myself, I think I'm more tired than I've been. Each month that passes means I've spent more time without seeing friends the way I used to see them, more time worrying, and more time holding off on doing things I love like traveling. On top of that, I am doing something I haven't done since March 2020 - go back into a physical classroom. I'll be honest, I'm nervous about this, especially because my daughter is not vaccinated and I would be crushed if I got her sick. For these reasons, I'm anticipating that this will be the most difficult semester yet. 

I suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the spring of 1919 had similar questions and concerns. I think it is worth remembering, though, that SLU turned 100 years old the year that pandemic started. Despite the 1918 flu pandemic, we're still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we'll get through this, just like SLU's graduating classes in the early 1920s did.

My goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our "new normal." I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your Fall semesters.

<br>

## Focusing on What Matters
First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we'll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them? 

In March 2020, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we have stayed health and have been able to see our families several times. We are lucky in that respect. For some of you, you may have experienced quarantining because you were exposed to someone who was ill. Perhaps you even became ill yourselves. All of this likely increases the stress of this semester - I know many of my students are anxious to avoid quarantine housing again.

On top of all this, we have new concerns, like being back in St. Louis away from our families again, and what 2021 will bring with new variants of COVID, breakthrough cases, and booster shots. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.

**All of this takes precedence over a semester's worth of college classes.** I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are "normal." We can't ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it's just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don't acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.

## Practice Self Care
The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - mostly running outdoors when it is nice and cycling indoors when the weather isn't great. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I'm home. I try to make time to read for pleasure. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day. 

Some of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/slu.edu/covid-19fall2020preparationmod/home/part-four-encouragement-and-support" target = "_blank">2020 Return to Campus Module</a> provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use. 

<br>

## What Will Class Be Like?
Details about assignments and readings are available in the syllabi for <a href = "https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus-alt/" target = "_blank">Section 1</a> and <a href = "https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus/" target = "_blank">Section 5</a>, but I wanted to give you all a quick preview of what the class materials will be like. Readings for the semester will come from one of three places:

  1. First, I am using a website called <a href = "https://www.sociologyexperiment.com" target = "_blank">A Sociology Experiment</a> instead of a regular text book. Chapters are written by leading sociologists, and cost $1 each. You'll only pay for the chapters you need. I know that the pandemic has created financial uncertainty for many of us, and providing you excellent resources for the lowest cost possible is important to me. 
  2. You'll also need to purchase a copy of <a href = "https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo37936174.html" target = "_blank">*Mama Might Be Better Off Dead*</a>, which retails for around $20 and is available at all the usual places you can buy books.
  3. I'll also share some readings and documentaries that you can access for free using the Library, even if you are off-campus for some of the semester.
  
We'll be using Canvas to access my slides and notes for each lecture, submit assignments, and take one of the three quizzes that will happen this semester. You'll take these outside of class, and have a 15 hour period of time to take each of them (from 7:00 AM CST until 10:00 PM CST). Once you start, you'll have 45 minutes to complete the 30 multiple choice questions. These quizzes aren't cumulative, and make up just over 25% of your final grade.

Most of your points this semester will therefore come from some short assignments that ask you to reflect on how sociological concepts have shaped your life ("Sociological Experiences"), create research questions based on social theory ("Theory Isn't Dead Posts"), and reflect on the content of *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead*. Rubrics and examples will be shared via our Canvas site for each of these assignments.

I also expect that you will come to class. I'll be taking attendance, which is something I have always done, but it has added weight this semester. To facilitate contact tracing efforts, we need to know who is attending class each day. Moreover, we need to know where each of you are sitting. So, not only will you need to sign in to class each day, but I will need you to sit in the same seat for each class meeting. On the first day of class, I'll be sending out a form to help create our seating chart.

The syllabus contains all the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes not just because of contact tracing needs but also so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can't attend classes occasionally, no worries. I'll work with you to get you a recording of the class (most likely from a prior semester). That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. There will be a participation grade (just over 16% of your final grade) that reflects these interactive aspects of class.

<br>

## What Happens If I Get Sick?
If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you're sick but not *very* sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I will ask, that even if you think it is "just a cold," you do not come to class and let Student Health know so that you can get a COVID-19 test. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.

If you have to move into quarantine housing, I will make sure you have a recording of my lecture (most likely from a prior semester) and any other resources you need to stay current with course work. I can also arrange for students in quarantine housing to Zoom into class on an as-needed basis - we'll cross that bridge if we have to! My point is - no matter what happens this semester to you, my goal is to make it as successful an academic experience as it can be.

<br>

## What Happens if We Have to Go Remote?
If (a) I cannot come to campus because I need to quarantine or (b) SLU switches to remote instruction either temporarily or for the remainder of the semester, we will move our entire course onto Zoom. In the case of an extended move to remote learning where students have to move out of campus housing, I have two "flex" days built into the syllabus so that we can reshuffle our schedule as needed. I have taught on Zoom for two and a half semesters now, and this course is designed to work in either face to face or remote settings with little change. 

About those "flex days" - if we don't need them (and I really hope we don't!), they will become days off for you all. I won't try to cram extra material in to the syllabus.

<br>

## What Will Office Hours Be Like?
My office hours are for you! I don't plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It's going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you've never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.

Unlike class, office hours will occur over Zoom. To help me manage, they are available by appointment only from 9am until 10:30am.
You will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you'll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information.

<br>

## Provisos
This is my plan as of August 20th, 2021. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Canvas regularly. I appreciate everyone's willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.
