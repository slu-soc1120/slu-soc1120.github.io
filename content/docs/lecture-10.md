## Confederate Monuments
The data we discussed about monuments to the Confederacy comes from a [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/) report on [Confederate Monuments](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy). An updated version of the image on the slides is also available [in the report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/com_whose_heritage_timeline_print.pdf). Among these are the schools I mentioned that are memorials to Confederate officers:

> Of the 103 public schools and three colleges named for Confederates leaders, those honoring Robert E. Lee are the most numerous (42), followed by Stonewall Jackson (15), Jefferson Davis (11), Nathan Bedford Forrest (8), P.G.T. Beauregard (7) and John Reagan (6).

I also mentioned the ties between [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day) and [Robert E. Lee Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_Day). The same [Southern Poverty Law Center report](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy) discusses these holidays that mark aspects of the Confederacy:

> The nine holidays officially observed in 2018 are: Alabama (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); Mississippi (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); South Carolina (Confederate Memorial Day); Texas (Confederate Heroes’ Day); Virginia (Lee-Jackson Day).

> The other states that have Confederate holidays in their state codes are Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.

Marking these holidays and the Civil War more generally as a war about "states' rights" or "northern aggression" is a cultural holdover from the ["Lost Cause" myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy). In DeKalb County, Georgia, officials have now installed a plaque next to an existing Confederate monument that [provides context about the "lost cause"](https://www.ajc.com/news/local/marker-supplies-historical-context-for-dekalb-confederate-monument/3mGyZ6ITzCEGVgz785O1zJ/?fbclid=IwAR0iRmJHE3WtLX7J17OJ6bcAplgrcn9eROfsmUCavlBsxp7fex-moAizXMw#).

One way in which these stories get [reified](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reify) is through secondary school education that highlights certain themes at the expense of others. The *New York Times* [recently compared](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/12/us/texas-vs-california-history-textbooks.html) two history textbooks from California and Texas to give readers a sense of how these books differ in the way they present history.

## Latino Health Paradox
While Latino immigrants [have better health on average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_paradox), one thing the documentary for today does not get into is that Latino is an overly broad term. [Recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5757955/) has found, for example, that not all Latinos in the United States have the same positive health advantages.

## Other People
We also briefly mentioned the following people:
* [Gen. Jubal Early, CSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubal_Early) (1816-1894) - solidified the idea of the ["Lost Cause"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy) myth in writings and public appearances
