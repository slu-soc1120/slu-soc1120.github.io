## Attendance
As the syllabus notes, this course does have an attendance policy. At the beginning of class, I'll ask everyone to scan a <a href = "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg" target = "_blank">QR code</a> that I post on-screen. You'll need a smartphone or a tablet with a camera to do this. Here are some instructions for devices that run <a href = "https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-ios/" target = "_blank">Apple's iOS</a> and <a href = "https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-android/" target = "_blank">Google's Android</a> operating systems. If you do not have a QR code reader built-in to your operating system, you will need to download a free third party application from your app store. **If you do not have access to a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible.**

## Virtual Office Hours
We don't always do a great job of explaining office hours to students, so I've put together <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/office-hours/" target = "_blank">an explainer on my website</a> to lay out what office hours are for, when you should come, and remind you that it is OK to stop by without an agenda!

For the 2020-2021 academic year, there are two types of office hours that I have:

  1. Appointments: Appoints are available for an hour each week from 9am CST to 10am CST on Wednesdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my <a href = "https://calendly.com/chris-prener" target = "_blank">Calendly page</a>. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you'll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link.
  2. Drop-in: From 10am CST to 10:45am CST on Wednesdays, I'll be available via Zoom for drop-in office hours. No appointment is required, and you'll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a "waiting room." I'll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately. The link for this is available on Blackboard.

If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I'll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.
