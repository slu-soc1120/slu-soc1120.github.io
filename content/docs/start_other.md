## Virtual Office Hours
We don't always do a great job of explaining office hours to students, so I've put together <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/office-hours/" target = "_blank">an explainer on my website</a> to lay out what office hours are for, when you should come, and remind you that it is OK to stop by without an agenda!

For the 2020-2021 academic year, there are two types of office hours that I have:

  1. Appointments: Appoints are available for an hour each week from 9am CST to 10am CST on Thursdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my <a href = "https://calendly.com/chris-prener" target = "_blank">Calendly page</a>. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you'll recieve a calendar invitation and a Zoom link.
  2. Drop-in: From 10am CST to 10:45am CST on Thursday, I'll be available via Zoom for drop-in office hours. No appointment is required, and you'll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a "waiting room." I'll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately. The link for this is available on Blackboard.

If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I'll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.
