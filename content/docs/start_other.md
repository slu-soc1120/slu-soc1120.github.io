## Attendance
As the syllabus notes, this course does have an attendance policy. At the beginning of class, I'll ask everyone to scan a <a href = "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg" target = "_blank">QR code</a> that I post on-screen. You'll need a smartphone or a tablet with a camera to do this. Here are some instructions for devices that run <a href = "https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-ios/" target = "_blank">Apple's iOS</a> and <a href = "https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-android/" target = "_blank">Google's Android</a> operating systems. If you do not have a QR code reader built-in to your operating system, you will need to download a free third party application from your app store. **If you do not have access to a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible.**
