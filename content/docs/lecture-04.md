## Stanford Prison Experiment
The experiment run by [Philip Zimbaro, Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo) quickly became notorious for the ethical lapses that occurred during its short run. However, [recent reporting](https://gen.medium.com/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62) has revealed that participants were coached and some of the seminal moments of the experiment were acted out. Though Zimbaro [has denied the allegations](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/28/17509470/stanford-prison-experiment-zimbardo-interview), the study is now an example not just of the ethics of conducting research but also reporting that research honestly as well.
