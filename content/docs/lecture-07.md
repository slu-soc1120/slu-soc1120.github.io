## Socialization
If you are looking to go further on this week's topics, I recommend this short encyclopedia entry on [socialization](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp.slu.edu/science/article/pii/B0080430767019641) as well as this recent ["pre-print"](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zp2wy/) reviewing the topic in sociology.

## People
We briefly mentioned the following people:

* [Charles Horton Cooley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cooley) (1864-1929) -American sociologist who developed the theory of the [looking glass self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking-glass_self).
* [Erving Goffman](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp.slu.edu/science/article/pii/B0080430767002497) (1921-1982) - American sociologist who made significant contributions to symbolic interactionism.
* [Pierre Bourdieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu) (1930-2002) - French sociologist who made significant contributions to the sociology of culture and eudcation, among other fields. 
* [Talcott Parsons](http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767003168) (1902-1979) - American sociologist best known for his now largely discredited theory of [structural functionalism](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp.slu.edu/science/article/pii/B0080430767018866). His work had a significant impact on the sociology of socialization.
