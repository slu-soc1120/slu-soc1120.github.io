I get a lot of questions, particularly from first year students, about the best ways to study for my exams. Here are some general thoughts on maximizing your changes for success.

<br>

## Get Everything Together
When I give advice, I assume that students have been taking notes on the readings, lectures, and documentaries. I think this is the single best things you can do to maximize your chances for success on my exams. When it is time to start studying, I recommend *synthesizing* everything. That is, taking all of your notes on a particular topic (like "Culture") and combining them together into a single study guide for each major heading on the syllabus. 

Focus on major headings and keywords from chapters and lectures, as well as the names that show up in readings and during class. The highest probability questions come from topics that appear in both the readings and the lectures, though I'll pull a few questions from the lectures that weren't part of a reading and vice versa. I tend to create exams that provide pretty even coverage of the lectures within each section.

## Studying for Multiple Choice Questions
Multiple choice questions tend to revolve around demonstrating that you know the definition of key terms or can reverse the process and identify a key term if given the definition. I sometimes test names of important sociologists directly - "which classical theorist is associated with theories related to organizations and bureaucracy?" (A: Weber). Other times I use the name as a hint or a clue regarding the correct answer. Other times I test both of these things by providing a scenario - "this particular person has been in the news - their leadership style is best represented by which of these Weberian ideal-types?"

You want to make sure you know, therefore, the main ideas expressed in each major topic of the course, the people that go along with them, the social theories we discuss, and the substance of really critical pieces of evidence (I might ask, for example, about the essential details from a documentary, case study, or illustrative example we've discussed in class). Often, questions related to this final point are pretty general and if you read between the lines, you can zero in on the correct answer if you think about the major themes at play even if you can't remember the specific example the question asks about.

## How do Course Docs fit in?
Starting with the Fall 2019 semester, I've begun posting materials here in the Course Docs. These are experimental, and will not necessarily be available for all weeks of my intro course. The intent of these is not to re-hash or cover course material, but rather to take you *further* if you *want to learn more*. This means I **will not be directly testing** the content of these pages. However, reading through them and using them as a jumping off point will help you learn the course material in a more thorough way. You should absolutely be able to be successful without them, of course, but you will be more confident in your mastery of the course material itself with them.

## Quiz Day
For this course, quizzes happen via Canvas. They're all multiple choice, and you can start the quiz at any time between 7:00AM CST and 10:00PM CST. Once you start the quiz, you have forty-five minutes to answer thirty questions. Since you're not taking this in the classroom, it would be silly to try and tell you not to use outside resources. That said, you don't have a *ton* of time for the quiz. Get yourself organized - if you've studied and worked on those guides that I describe above, you're going to have a much easier time taking the quiz. Conversely, if you try to Google your way through the quiz or rummage through class and reading notes, it is going to be a tough quiz to finish. Please do not close your computer, let it go to sleep, or let it get disconnected from the internet. If you run into technical issues with Canvas, or get disconnected from the quiz, please email me right away. However, because I cannot be equally available and responsive during the fifteen hour period when the quiz is open, I cannot answer substantive questions over email.
