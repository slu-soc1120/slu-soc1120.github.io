Letters of recommendation, or references more generally, are an important part of many internship, job, and graduate school applications. For this class in particular, I get *a lot* of requests for pre-med evaluations as part of the committee process, particularly for students who are in the Medical Scholars program. As faculty, we get requests every semester from students to (ideally) sing their praises. So, we expect you to ask! However, I've found that students are sometimes unsure both *who* to ask and *how to ask*.

<br>

## Who to Ask
**Ask professors who know you well and will have a lot to say about you.** For me, this means I've been able to get to know you outside of class. If you've never spoken up in class, come to office hours, or otherwise had some kind of interaction with me, it is nearly impossible for me to write a convincing, comprehensive letter of recommendation. This means you need to *think ahead*! Don't wait until you need a letter from me to swing by my office - start building that relationship well ahead of time so that, when it comes time to ask for the favor of a letter (and it will come time!), I am able to enthusiastically say 'yes'.

Letters are easiest to write for students who I have had in more than one class. So, if you've only known me briefly and in a limited way, you should consider asking a faculty member who knows you better. Similarly, if you did not do well in the only class you've had with me, you are better off asking another faculty member who can speak to your strengths.

Another "trick" is to think of faculty as being specialists. I *can* write a letter of recommendation on your behalf for admission to a doctoral program in chemistry, but do you really want me to? My letter will not carry the weight that a letter would from a faculty member in chemistry or an allied discipline.

The questions I suggest students ask themselves before approaching faculty are therefore:

1. How well does the professor know me?
2. Which of my strengths can they speak to?
3. Can they uniquely speak to something related to this job/internship/graduate school application?

If you aren't sure if I am the best fit or not, swing by my office to ask! I'm happy to entertain informal requests and talk with you about the letter writing process ahead of time.

## How to Ask
First and foremost, **ask**! Nothing is more frustrating with this process than being cold-called by a colleague, an HR staff member, or by a supervisor asking for a recommendation that I am not prepared to give. 

When you ask, **ask well ahead of time**. This is less important if I am only serving as a reference and will not be required to write a letter on your behalf. I need, typically, at least **two weeks notice** before a submission deadline for a student who I have not written a letter for previously.

When you approach me, make sure you **have everything I will need** in hand. This means:

1. a description of the position you are applying for, 
2. a few ideas of things you want me to emphasize in my letter, 
3. an updated resume, 
4. and instructions on how I should submit your letter.

If you are asking me to provide letters for more than one or two jobs, internships, or schools, please also provide a **Google sheet** that breaks down each position by deadline so that I can make sure all of the letters get to their destinations on time. 

Once you have all of your materials together, please **come see me in person** instead of just emailing me. This will allow me the chance to ask you questions about the position and make sure I have everything that I need to write the best letter possible.

<br>

## If I Say 'No'
Please be forewarned that **I might say 'no' to a request** if I do not feel like I can write you a positive or comprehensive letter. This may be because you have not done well in my classes, or because I don't know you well outside of class. This is particularly true for my larger classes like Introduction to Sociology, where I do not get a chance to know many students outside of the classroom. This goes back to my earlier advice - make sure you are asking faculty who know you well and who can speak to your strengths! I also might say 'no' if I am not given sufficient lead time, so please heed my advice about asking for a letter early.

If I say 'no', please do not take it personally. I get multiple requests for recommendations and letters each semester, and I need to prioritize students that I am best positioned to write about. If I don't feel like that is you, I'll be more than happy to help you brainstorm about who might be best to ask. 

<br>

## Following Up
Once you've asked, and I've said 'yes', **please follow-up as deadlines approach**. I do my best to get letters in before deadlines, and will reach out as I submit letters on your behalf to let you know about my progress. However, it is in your best interest to reach out if you have not heard from me and a deadline is approaching. Please don't feel shy about reaching out.

Likewise, if you get one of the positions I've written a letter for, **let me know**! It is always gratifying to hear about your successes, so please reach out with the good news!
