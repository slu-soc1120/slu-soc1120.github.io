Settling into college can be daunting - there are a host of new relationships to navigate (roommates, advisers, faculty) and a whole new set of [social and cultural norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) to follow and occasionally break. Below are some tips for surviving in this brave new world you've found yourself in!

<br>

## What to Call Us
If you're coming from high school, you're probably used to calling your teachers "Mrs." or "Mr." or "Miss.". This is *not* the approach you should take with professors. Universities have an elaborate [division of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour), and faculty often (but not always) have doctorates. The honorifics we use reflect this, and you want to make sure you get this right. 

Always, always, always call faculty you haven't met before "Doctor" or "Professor." If you're not sure if your professor has a doctorate or not, feel free to use "Professor." Better to over-assume their credentials and have them correct you than the opposite. If  you're cold calling or emailing someone, assume that they prefer to use "Doctor" or "Professor." The same is true if faculty do not tell you what to call them on the first day of class - it is better to be overly polite than it is to take an informal approach. 

You can look for clues in how we sign our emails. If a professor signs with their first name, this is typically invitation to respond using their first name as well. If a professor signs their emails with initials, it's best to stick with "Doctor" or "Professor" (or "Dr." / "Prof"). 

Some professors are OK with students using their first name (I let my students call me Chris, for example). However, even if a professor says it is OK to use their first name, it is also totally fine to continue to use honorifics with them.

This can all seem a bit petty, but it's an important exercise in acknowledging the division of labor you're a part of. This is especially true for faculty from groups typically underrepresented in academia (women in many disciplines, and faculty from racial and ethnic minority groups). Their expertise is unfortunately questioned or ignored, and using honorifics signals that you acknowledge that expertise in a small but meaningful way.

## Writing Emails
Many of the interactions you'll have with faculty are going to be over email, so it is worth taking just a bit of time to put some thought into how you do that. First, always use your university email account. This will clearly identify who you are in a way that a gmail account may not ("skibum02@gmail.com", for example). Second, when you start the email, make sure you get the honorific right (see above) and make sure you spell our names correctly. Beyond that, I love the tips in [this fantastic medium post](https://medium.com/@lportwoodstacer/how-to-email-your-professor-without-being-annoying-af-cf64ae0e4087) for putting together an effective email to professors (or really anyone) - follow them all!

While we're on the subject, it is also important to remember that this is the way the University and faculty are going to communicate with you. You need to check your email daily!

<br>

## Show Us the Love
We're humans, too (I swear), and that means we have egos, sensitivities, and even feelings from time to time. While deep down we know that you have multiple priorities and our class may not always be at the top of your list, you also don't need to rub it in. In particular, you want to avoid telegraphing to professors that you are only taking the class for a requirement, or because it doesn't meet on Fridays (a game I played in college). There are some professors who might be OK with hearing this, but I'd say we're in the minority and it is better to assume that it won't be taken well.

<br>

## Remember There Are Many of You
Most of you will have somewhere between four and six professors each semester. In contrast, I typically have 50-100 students in a given semester here at SLU. I find that students often either (a) forgot that this imbalance exists or (b) assume that because this imbalance exists, we don't have time. Nothing could be further from the truth - we'll always make time for your email or meeting, but just need you to remember the imbalance and be patient with us.

Another thing that students often don't understand is that teaching is only part of our job. We also are expected to be actively engaged with research and writing during the semester, and be involved with what we call service (typically helping our Department, College, or discipline run). Again, this doesn't mean that we aren't able to help or don't want to help, but that we may not be at our desk every day or have availability certain times of the week.

<br>

## Follow Through, But Admit When You Can't
Another part of showing us the love is following through. If you say you're going to come to office hours, come! If you volunteer to help with some research, make sure you fulfill your end of the arrangement you make with us. If you cannot follow through, a quick email saying something came up goes a long way. Students sometimes drop off the radar, and its much better to be upfront with us about whatever change or challenge has come up.

<br>

## Keep Yourself Organized
Time management is a skill that I see a lot of students struggle with (and that I struggled with in college). [Dartmouth](https://students.dartmouth.edu/academic-skills/learning-resources/time-management-) has a great set of resources for managing yourself, getting and staying organized, and using a calendar. This is especially important because most professors will tell you that they're going to treat you like an adult - our job isn't to nag you, make you come to class, or check in constantly. This is a bit different than the role that teachers in high school fulfill. If you decide you don't want to do an assignment, or come to class, ultimately we'll let you make those decisions and we'll expect you to understand that there may be consequences (typically in the form of grades that cannot be revised or changed). 

So, keeping yourself organized is critical to being successful! Whatever you do does not need to be elaborate or technologically sophisticated - a pad that you use to write down what you need to accomplish each day and a simple calendar can be enough. The importat thing is to start early with good organization habits.

## Communicate Ahead of Time
One of the biggest mistakes students make is that they wait until it is too late to ask for help or extensions. Almost all the faculty I know, including myself, would rather have these discussions as soon as you know there is an issue. I will bend over backwards to help students if I can, but I also need to know that there is a need out there that needs to be addressed. This is particularly important because of what I said above about there being many of you - sometimes we need a day or two to follow-up, and so communicating ahead of time helps us help you just a bit more effectively and efficiently.

<br>

## Take Care of Yourself
For many of you, this is your first time out on your own. We're all going to treat you like an adult. When we say that in this context, we mean that if you want to stay up all night, only eat ice cream, and nap during the afternoon, we're not going to stand in your way. While it is fun to exercise some new forms of autonomy, it can also be easy to get sucked into habits that ultimately are destructive. Similarly, it can be easy to float or disengage from things like school work. While you should absolutely have fun, cut loose, and enjoy being out on your own, you should also start working now on self care and stress management. You will need these skills to be successful here, and you will have a lot more fun if you are not constantly under the burdens of stress, anxiety, or depression.

## Ask for Help
If you aren't sure exactly how to deal with stress, depression, anxiety, or another problem, please ask us for help (we've been there, trust me). If you need immediate help, SLU's [University Counseling Center](https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/university-counseling/index.php) can be reached at 314-977-TALK. There are also a host of resources both [within SLU and outside of SLU](https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/university-counseling/crisis-resources.php) that are at your disposal. If whatever is going on in your life is going to impact your school work, you also need to talk to your professors. You don't need to give us all the details, but we need to at least know that you're facing some challenges. We may have to check in with the University about some of this, so know that what you tell us may not be able to be kept just between us. But please, if you find yourself underwater or struggling, ask *someone* for help. We want you to be happy and successful!
