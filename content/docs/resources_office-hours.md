In my experience, we don't do a great job communicating to students about what office hours are for and when you should come to them. So, if you've had questions about what office hours are or when to come, you are not alone!

<br>

## What Office Hours Are
I'll start with what I think we (professors) think is obvious but in practice is not always - office hours are **for you**! This is time we reserve each week for students to drop by, get help, or just catch up. I may spend the time doing work if I'm not meeting with students, but its work I am happy (and able) to stop if you want to chat. So, if you come to my office (or to the lab where I sometimes hold office hours), you are definitely not interrupting. In fact, I'd **rather** talk to you then do work. Getting to know students is part of my job, and one that I particularly enjoy.

## When to Come
Most students are not a weekly presence at office hours, so the next real question is when you should come. To some degree this depends on your goal. If you want to stop by and talk about a specific assignment or grade, it helps to come as soon as you've received your grade. If you want to talk about [studying for quizzes](docs/resources_quizzes/), try to come a couple of weeks before an quiz rather than right before it - that will give you time to alter any study practices based on our conversation. The same is true if you want to proactively address an assignment - don't come right before it is due, but rather a couple weeks out!

## It's OK to Just Chat
You don't need an excuse to come to office hours beyond wanting to talk, though. Getting to know faculty is important, even when you are a first year student. We can help you pick classes, think about study abroad, find internships, or just talk about survival strategies if that is what you need. You'll also need us for some of those things - letters of recommendation are sometimes needed for study abroad, and often needed for things like internships, graduate school, and medical school. It is much, much harder to write letters that are convincing and compelling if you don't know the student well, and [I may say no to students if I don't know them outside of the classroom](docs/resources_letters/). Lay the foundation for this early - come back and check in - you don't need to stay long.

## They Aren't Just for Current Students
You also don't have to be in a class with me that semester to come by - I love catching up with students from previous semesters. Come back and tell me how your semester abroad, your summer touring with the Dead, or your sweet data science internship turned out!

## Virtual Office Hours
For the 2021-2022 academic year,  appointments are available for an hour and a half each week from 9am CST to 10:30am CST on Wednesdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my <a href = "https://calendly.com/chris-prener" target = "_blank">Calendly page</a>. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you'll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link.

If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I'll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.
