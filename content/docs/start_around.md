## What Are the Main Course Resources?
There are three big resources that you'll be using this semester to take this class:

  1. The first is **<a href = "http://canvas.slu.edu" target = "_blank">Canvas</a>**. We'll be using Canvas for getting access to course materials like slides and notes, finding recordings of lectures, taking quizzes, and making discussion board posts.
  2. The second is our **syllabus,** which is available for <a href = "https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus-alt/" target = "_blank">Section 1</a> and <a href = "https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus/" target = "_blank">Section 5</a>. The syllabus contains all the course policies, due dates, readings, documentary links, and is your user guide to the class.
  3. Finally, we have this **[course website](https://slu-soc1120.github.io)** that includes links to all of these materials as well as a "docs" section (which you're in right now!) that has additional links to videos, news stories, biographies, and other relevant materials. These will help you get the most out of the class! I do this publicly so that I can share these resources between sections.

I do my best to provide links between these difference sources as often as possible. However, I recommend bookmarking the course website, which includes links to everything.

## How Is the Course Organized?
The course is organized into four parts:

  1. Thinking Like Sociologists - an introduction to the discipline of sociology, social theory, social science research methods, and the basics of what we call "social structure" - the way societies are organized
  2. Building Blocks of Society - an introduction to the key aspects of society, including culture, socioeconomic status, and gender and sexuality
  3. The Broken Heart of America - an overview of race and ethnicity in the United States, intersectionality theory, and urban social problems
  4. Course Conclusion - wrapping up the semester

Each Part has at least two "modules" - collections of lectures, readings, documentaries, and assignments. You'll find the left-hand menu bar on Canvas as well as in the course docs on the website are both organized by these modules. They'll be released one at a time as we go through the semester.

## How Do I Stay Up-to-date?
First and foremost, come to class. I start every class with "front matter" that includes announcements and upcoming deadlines. I also end class with "back matter," which reviews some of the most important announcements.

I'll also use Canvas's Announcements page to send you emails about class. This means you *need to check your email regularly.* This means every day, multiple times per day.
