I have writing assignments in all of my classes (even my methods classes), and there are definitely patterns for where students get things right and wrong when it comes to writing assignments. Here are a couple of tips for maximizing your rate of success when it comes to social science writing.

<br>

## Make a Plan
Write an outline - it can just be a few bullet points on a sheet of paper to start. Particularly for students coming from the world of lab sciences, where lab notes have structure to them, even a short writing assignment where you open up a blank document can be daunting. So don't open up that blank document without a plan! Start with bullet points, then add in main ideas and supporting evidence. Work yourself towards a paragraph by paragraph or (for longer assignments) a section by section plan for approaching writing.

<br>

## Include a Road-map in Your Intro
Introductions are hard to write, and some folks recommend that you write it at the end so that you can convincingly lay out what you actually did (as opposed to what you thought you'd do but didn't end up doing). No matter when you write it, make sure you have a clear road-map for your paper - tell your audience (so, me!) what you intend to **show** in your paper.

<br>

## Have An Argument
Another place introductions go awry is that they don't actually take a stand. What is the **point** of your paper? What are you trying to illustrate or convince your audience (so, me!) of?

<br>

## But Avoid Hyperbole
That said, having an over-the-top argument is just as bad. It is a good idea to avoid saying things like "the most severe problem in America" because I will inevitably write back that this might not actually be the case. You want to be a bit circumspect with your language without being unclear - this is a practice that takes time to develop.

<br>

## Be Succinct and Organized
One common thing I see with undergraduate writing is that it can... ramble. I think that having a plan (see above) can help address this to some degree. One way to avoid this is to make sure you're aggressively using paragraph breaks. Your paragraph should not run for a full page, and your sentences need to be well organized, too (none of us are [William Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness), right?!). You want each paragraph to have a point, and want to make sure it is working in the service of your larger argument. Your paragraphs need to **flow** from one to the other (we call these "transitions"), and writing good transitions is **hard**.

<br>

## Avoid Contractions
One of the most common pieces of feedback I give, aside from the need for more paragraph breaks, is to write out "do not" instead of saying "don't." Why? Using contractions can convey an informal sense to your readers, and you want to avoid doing that.

<br>

## Learn Grammar Rules
For example, make sure you're comfortable with "their" and "their" (but don't worry about "they're", because you're avoiding contractions, right?). Here is a [great rundown](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/30-grammar-mistakes-writers-should-avoid/) of some common grammar mistakes to avoid.

<br>

## Write Actively
Professors strongly dislike [writing that uses passive voice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/passive-voice/). Make sure you work on spotting it in your own work and writing your papers in an active voice as much as you can!

<br>

## Don't Do It The Night Before
Give yourself time to proofread. Perhaps the night before is sufficient for this if you can come back to it in the morning, but the more time you give yourself for this, the better. I'll even look at work if I've got enough lead time (at least a week in advance of the due date).

If you find you struggle with clarity, reading your work out loud can be really helpful. Its awkward, of course, so do it in a space where you're alone (the library probably isn't an ideal place for this exercise). Another strategy that I use for my own work is to use a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com). It has helped me improve my writing, and I'm an enthusiastic supporter of the platform!

<br>

## Reward Yourself
Writing is hard, and it doesn't happen all at once. This is another reason not to start the night before. Have a breakthrough or finish a hard section? Go celebrate! Get it all submitted? Celebrate some more! You worked hard and deserve a chance to give yourself a high five or a pint of ice cream. Or both.
