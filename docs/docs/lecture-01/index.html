<p>Census tracts are areas defined by the

They can be virtually any size, but have a typical population of 4,000 people (so they&rsquo;re often bigger in rural areas and smaller in cities). The Census Bureau has an excellent

<h2 id="elizabeth-eckford">Elizabeth Eckford</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eckford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Eckford</a> (b. 1941) was one of the first students to desegregate Little Rock, Arkansas&rsquo;s Central High School. Known as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Little Rock Nine&rdquo;</a>, they faced protests and the Arkansas National Guard, who were called in to bar the students from the school. 
<a href="">President Eisenhower</a> ultimately 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_National_Guard_and_the_integration_of_Central_High_School" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federalized the Arkansas National Guard</a> and dispatched active duty soliders from the Army&rsquo;s 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">101st Airborne Division</a> to ensure the students were able to enter the school and attend classes. Eckford became well known because of a photo taken by journalist Will Counts on the first day of the students&rsquo; effort to attend the High School. Counts&rsquo;s photo of a white student named Hazel Bryan screaming at Eckford 
<a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-story-behind-the-famous-little-rock-nine-scream-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would become an iconic image</a>. The two women briefly attempted to reconcile later in life, but ultimately found they were unable to.</p>

<h2 id="emmett-till">Emmett Till</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emmett Till</a> (1941-1955) was a young men from Chicago who was savagedly beaten and then shot before his body was dumped in the Tallahatchie River near Money, MS. His murder was retribution for Till&rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for 
<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Blood-of-Emmett-Till/Timothy-B-Tyson/9781476714851" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Blood of Emmett Till</em></a> (

Bryant&rsquo;s husband and his friend were charged with the murder and exonerated by an all white jury, but later admitted (protected by double jeopardy) that they had committed the crime. After <em>The Blood of Emmett Till</em> was published in 2017, the F.B.I. annouced that they were

The case itself gained substantial national noteriety because Till&rsquo;s mother insisted that photos of his mutiliated body be published.</p>
<p>Till&rsquo;s death is an example of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lynching</a>, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gross domestic product</a>, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we&rsquo;ll express GDP in

<br>
<h2 id="infant-mortality-rate">Infant Mortality Rate</h2>
<p>The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a

<h2 id="lead-poisoning">Lead Poisoning</h2>
<p>Our second &ldquo;parable&rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. Lead was commonly 
<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/leaded-gas-poison-invented-180961368/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added to gasoline</a> to improve engine efficiency and to

Leaded paint was banned in 1978, lead in pipes in and solder/flux in 1986, and leaded gasoline was finally phased out in 1995, even though 
<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/leaded-gas-poison-invented-180961368/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists knew throughout the 20th century</a> that lead was highly toxic (though companies involved in lead production denied its toxicity publicly).</p>

<h2 id="life-expectancy">Life Expectancy</h2>
<p>When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live <em>on average</em>. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.</p>

<h2 id="the-lovings">The Lovings</h2>
<p>Mildred Loving (d. 2008) and Richard Loving (d. 1975) were the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the State of Virgina challenging the state&rsquo;s 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Integrity_Act_of_1924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racial Integrity Act of 1924</a>, which banned interracial marriage (these were called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;anti-miscegenation laws&rdquo;</a>). The Lovings had been charged under this statute in 1958, and subsequently sued Virginia. Their lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loving v. Virginia</a> (1968) that these laws violated the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s

<h2 id="norman-rockwell">Norman Rockwell</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norman Rockwell</a> (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Saturday Evening Post</em></a>. We discussed two of his paintings - 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saying_Grace_%28Rockwell%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Saying Grace</em></a> (1951) and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Problem We all Live With</em></a> (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting 
<a href="#ruby-bridges">Ruby Bridges</a> to elementary school in New Orleans during that city&rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you&rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the

<br>
<h2 id="per-capita-statistics">Per Capita Statistics</h2>
<p>The term &ldquo;per capita&rdquo; means &ldquo;per person.&rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using 
<a href="#health-care-spending">OECD data</a>). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more <em>per person,</em> but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we&rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We&rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="rates">Rates</h2>
<p>Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we&rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare 
<a href="#health-care-spending">infant mortality</a> across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using 
<a href="#infant-mortality-rate">infant mortality rate</a>. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="rates-per-capita">Rates Per Capita</h2>
<p>In order to compare 
<a href="#rates">rates</a> across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize 
<a href="#per-capita-statistics">per capita statistics</a>. When we calculate a &ldquo;rate per capita&rdquo; or a &ldquo;per capita rate,&rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate 
<a href="#infant-mortality-rate">infant mortality rate</a> by multiplying a given entity&rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city&rsquo;s or state&rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="ruby-bridges">Ruby Bridges</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Bridges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruby Bridges</a> (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in 
<a href="#norman-rockwell">Norman Rockwell&rsquo;s</a> 1964 painting 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Problem We all Live With</em></a>. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="the-stroke-belt">The Stroke Belt</h2>
<p>The third parable for this week was about America&rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the 
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/maps_data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</a>, and I&rsquo;ve shared the 
<a href="https://github.com/slu-soc1120/US_OUTCOMES_Stroke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps and the code used to make them</a>. The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by 
<a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/maria.glymour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maria Glymour, Ph.D.</a>, an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047279708002986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race and childhood poverty</a>. Glymour&rsquo;s work has also found elevated risk for individuals who are 
<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.482059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">born in these states</a> as well as individuals who 
<a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/73/22/1858.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live in them during adulthood</a>. However, there is still quite a bit we don&rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where 
<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rates are lower</a>).</p>
