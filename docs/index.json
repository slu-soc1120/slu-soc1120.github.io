In early May, it felt like this fall might be \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; - widespread vaccination at SLU would mean we could have class, go to the dining hall, go to Chaifetz Arena, and hang out with friends like SLU students were able to do in the Fall 2020. The last three months in Missouri and elsewhere in the United States have shown us that we cannot expect a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; semester. We simultaneously have more risk (in the form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u0026rsquo;s Delta variant, which spreads more efficiently than other forms of SARS-CoV-2) and more hope (almost everyone on campus is vaccinated and boosters are on the way for the most vulnerable members of our community).\nAll of this raises more novel questions for us to confront. Will indoor mask requirements be relaxed at any point before December? When will we be able to get booster shots? What happens if we get a breakthrough case? If this is your first semester at SLU, you probably have even more questions about starting at a new institution in the middle of a pandemic.\nIn some ways, I think we\u0026rsquo;re starting this semester in an even more challenging position. As I write this, it\u0026rsquo;s been over seventeen months now since we began practicing physical distancing and limiting activities in places outside of our home. Speaking for myself, I think I\u0026rsquo;m more tired than I\u0026rsquo;ve been. Each month that passes means I\u0026rsquo;ve spent more time without seeing friends the way I used to see them, more time worrying, and more time holding off on doing things I love like traveling. On top of that, I am doing something I haven\u0026rsquo;t done since March 2020 - go back into a physical classroom. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m nervous about this, especially because my daughter is not vaccinated and I would be crushed if I got her sick. For these reasons, I\u0026rsquo;m anticipating that this will be the most difficult semester yet.\nI suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the spring of 1919 had similar questions and concerns. I think it is worth remembering, though, that SLU turned 100 years old the year that pandemic started. Despite the 1918 flu pandemic, we\u0026rsquo;re still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we\u0026rsquo;ll get through this, just like SLU\u0026rsquo;s graduating classes in the early 1920s did.\nMy goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our \u0026ldquo;new normal.\u0026rdquo; I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your Fall semesters.\nFocusing on What Matters First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we\u0026rsquo;ll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them?\nIn March 2020, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we have stayed health and have been able to see our families several times. We are lucky in that respect. For some of you, you may have experienced quarantining because you were exposed to someone who was ill. Perhaps you even became ill yourselves. All of this likely increases the stress of this semester - I know many of my students are anxious to avoid quarantine housing again.\nOn top of all this, we have new concerns, like being back in St. Louis away from our families again, and what 2021 will bring with new variants of COVID, breakthrough cases, and booster shots. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.\nAll of this takes precedence over a semester\u0026rsquo;s worth of college classes. I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are \u0026ldquo;normal.\u0026rdquo; We can\u0026rsquo;t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it\u0026rsquo;s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.\nPractice Self Care The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - mostly running outdoors when it is nice and cycling indoors when the weather isn\u0026rsquo;t great. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I\u0026rsquo;m home. I try to make time to read for pleasure. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day.\nSome of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the 2020 Return to Campus Module provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use.\nWhat Will Class Be Like? Details about assignments and readings are available in the syllabi for Section 1 and Section 5, but I wanted to give you all a quick preview of what the class materials will be like. Readings for the semester will come from one of three places:\n First, I am using a website called A Sociology Experiment instead of a regular text book. Chapters are written by leading sociologists, and cost $1 each. You\u0026rsquo;ll only pay for the chapters you need. I know that the pandemic has created financial uncertainty for many of us, and providing you excellent resources for the lowest cost possible is important to me. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to purchase a copy of Mama Might Be Better Off Dead, which retails for around $20 and is available at all the usual places you can buy books. I\u0026rsquo;ll also share some readings and documentaries that you can access for free using the Library, even if you are off-campus for some of the semester.  We\u0026rsquo;ll be using Canvas to access my slides and notes for each lecture, submit assignments, and take one of the three quizzes that will happen this semester. You\u0026rsquo;ll take these outside of class, and have a 15 hour period of time to take each of them (from 7:00 AM CST until 10:00 PM CST). Once you start, you\u0026rsquo;ll have 45 minutes to complete the 30 multiple choice questions. These quizzes aren\u0026rsquo;t cumulative, and make up just over 25% of your final grade.\nMost of your points this semester will therefore come from some short assignments that ask you to reflect on how sociological concepts have shaped your life (\u0026ldquo;Sociological Experiences\u0026rdquo;), create research questions based on social theory (\u0026ldquo;Theory Isn\u0026rsquo;t Dead Posts\u0026rdquo;), and reflect on the content of Mama Might Be Better Off Dead. Rubrics and examples will be shared via our Canvas site for each of these assignments.\nI also expect that you will come to class. I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking attendance, which is something I have always done, but it has added weight this semester. To facilitate contact tracing efforts, we need to know who is attending class each day. Moreover, we need to know where each of you are sitting. So, not only will you need to sign in to class each day, but I will need you to sit in the same seat for each class meeting. On the first day of class, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sending out a form to help create our seating chart.\nThe syllabus contains all the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes not just because of contact tracing needs but also so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can\u0026rsquo;t attend classes occasionally, no worries. I\u0026rsquo;ll work with you to get you a recording of the class (most likely from a prior semester). That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. There will be a participation grade (just over 16% of your final grade) that reflects these interactive aspects of class.\nWhat Happens If I Get Sick? If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you\u0026rsquo;re sick but not very sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I will ask, that even if you think it is \u0026ldquo;just a cold,\u0026rdquo; you do not come to class and let Student Health know so that you can get a COVID-19 test. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.\nIf you have to move into quarantine housing, I will make sure you have a recording of my lecture (most likely from a prior semester) and any other resources you need to stay current with course work. I can also arrange for students in quarantine housing to Zoom into class on an as-needed basis - we\u0026rsquo;ll cross that bridge if we have to! My point is - no matter what happens this semester to you, my goal is to make it as successful an academic experience as it can be.\nWhat Happens if We Have to Go Remote? If (a) I cannot come to campus because I need to quarantine or (b) SLU switches to remote instruction either temporarily or for the remainder of the semester, we will move our entire course onto Zoom. In the case of an extended move to remote learning where students have to move out of campus housing, I have two \u0026ldquo;flex\u0026rdquo; days built into the syllabus so that we can reshuffle our schedule as needed. I have taught on Zoom for two and a half semesters now, and this course is designed to work in either face to face or remote settings with little change.\nAbout those \u0026ldquo;flex days\u0026rdquo; - if we don\u0026rsquo;t need them (and I really hope we don\u0026rsquo;t!), they will become days off for you all. I won\u0026rsquo;t try to cram extra material in to the syllabus.\nWhat Will Office Hours Be Like? My office hours are for you! I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you\u0026rsquo;ve never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.\nUnlike class, office hours will occur over Zoom. To help me manage, they are available by appointment only from 9am until 10:30am. You will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information.\nProvisos This is my plan as of August 20th, 2021. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Canvas regularly. I appreciate everyone\u0026rsquo;s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.\nAcknowledgements Special thanks to Dr. Amy Cooper for sharing her language and policies around COVID-19 modifications, which inspired the original version of this page published in Spring 2020.\n","date":1611529200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611529200,"objectID":"e3929e7811cae4df82f88504a7e7458b","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/covid19/","publishdate":"2021-01-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/covid19/","section":"","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe, but we\u0026rsquo;re facing our fourth semester dramatically altered by our public health situation.

An updated version of the image on the slides is also available in the report. Among these are the schools I mentioned that are memorials to Confederate officers:\n Of the 103 public schools and three colleges named for Confederates leaders, those honoring Robert E. Lee are the most numerous (42), followed by Stonewall Jackson (15), Jefferson Davis (11), Nathan Bedford Forrest (8), P.G.T. Beauregard (7) and John Reagan (6).\n I also mentioned the ties between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Robert E. Lee Day. The same Southern Poverty Law Center report discusses these holidays that mark aspects of the Confederacy:\n The nine holidays officially observed in 2018 are: Alabama (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); Mississippi (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); South Carolina (Confederate Memorial Day); Texas (Confederate Heroes’ Day); Virginia (Lee-Jackson Day).\n  The other states that have Confederate holidays in their state codes are Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.\n Marking these holidays and the Civil War more generally as a war about \u0026ldquo;states' rights\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;northern aggression\u0026rdquo; is a cultural holdover from the \u0026ldquo;Lost Cause\u0026rdquo; myth. In DeKalb County, Georgia, officials have now installed a plaque next to an existing Confederate monument that provides context about the \u0026ldquo;lost cause\u0026rdquo;.\nOne way in which these stories get reified is through secondary school education that highlights certain themes at the expense of others.

The second is our syllabus, which is available for Section 1 and Section 5. The syllabus contains all the course policies, due dates, readings, documentary links, and is your user guide to the class. Finally, we have this  course website that includes links to all of these materials as well as a \u0026ldquo;docs\u0026rdquo; section (which you\u0026rsquo;re in right now!) that has additional links to videos, news stories, biographies, and other relevant materials. These will help you get the most out of the class! I do this publicly so that I can share these resources between sections.  I do my best to provide links between these difference sources as often as possible. However, I recommend bookmarking the course website, which includes links to everything.\nHow Is the Course Organized? The course is organized into four parts:\n Thinking Like Sociologists - an introduction to the discipline of sociology, social theory, social science research methods, and the basics of what we call \u0026ldquo;social structure\u0026rdquo; - the way societies are organized Building Blocks of Society - an introduction to the key aspects of society, including culture, socioeconomic status, and gender and sexuality The Broken Heart of America - an overview of race and ethnicity in the United States, intersectionality theory, and urban social problems Course Conclusion - wrapping up the semester  Each Part has at least two \u0026ldquo;modules\u0026rdquo; - collections of lectures, readings, documentaries, and assignments.

For this class in particular, I get a lot of requests for pre-med evaluations as part of the committee process, particularly for students who are in the Medical Scholars program. As faculty, we get requests every semester from students to (ideally) sing their praises. So, we expect you to ask! However, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that students are sometimes unsure both who to ask and how to ask.\nWho to Ask Ask professors who know you well and will have a lot to say about you. For me, this means I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to get to know you outside of class. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never spoken up in class, come to office hours, or otherwise had some kind of interaction with me, it is nearly impossible for me to write a convincing, comprehensive letter of recommendation. This means you need to think ahead! Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until you need a letter from me to swing by my office - start building that relationship well ahead of time so that, when it comes time to ask for the favor of a letter (and it will come time!), I am able to enthusiastically say \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;.\nLetters are easiest to write for students who I have had in more than one class. So, if you\u0026rsquo;ve only known me briefly and in a limited way, you should consider asking a faculty member who knows you better. Similarly, if you did not do well in the only class you\u0026rsquo;ve had with me, you are better off asking another faculty member who can speak to your strengths.\nAnother \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; is to think of faculty as being specialists. I can write a letter of recommendation on your behalf for admission to a doctoral program in chemistry, but do you really want me to? My letter will not carry the weight that a letter would from a faculty member in chemistry or an allied discipline.\nThe questions I suggest students ask themselves before approaching faculty are therefore:\n How well does the professor know me? Which of my strengths can they speak to? Can they uniquely speak to something related to this job/internship/graduate school application?  If you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure if I am the best fit or not, swing by my office to ask! I\u0026rsquo;m happy to entertain informal requests and talk with you about the letter writing process ahead of time.\nHow to Ask First and foremost, ask! Nothing is more frustrating with this process than being cold-called by a colleague, an HR staff member, or by a supervisor asking for a recommendation that I am not prepared to give.\nWhen you ask, ask well ahead of time. This is less important if I am only serving as a reference and will not be required to write a letter on your behalf. I need, typically, at least two weeks notice before a submission deadline for a student who I have not written a letter for previously.\nWhen you approach me, make sure you have everything I will need in hand. This means:\n a description of the position you are applying for, a few ideas of things you want me to emphasize in my letter, an updated resume, and instructions on how I should submit your letter.  If you are asking me to provide letters for more than one or two jobs, internships, or schools, please also provide a Google sheet that breaks down each position by deadline so that I can make sure all of the letters get to their destinations on time.\nOnce you have all of your materials together, please come see me in person instead of just emailing me. This will allow me the chance to ask you questions about the position and make sure I have everything that I need to write the best letter possible.\nIf I Say \u0026lsquo;No\u0026rsquo; Please be forewarned that I might say \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; to a request if I do not feel like I can write you a positive or comprehensive letter. This may be because you have not done well in my classes, or because I don\u0026rsquo;t know you well outside of class. This is particularly true for my larger classes like Introduction to Sociology, where I do not get a chance to know many students outside of the classroom. This goes back to my earlier advice - make sure you are asking faculty who know you well and who can speak to your strengths! I also might say \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; if I am not given sufficient lead time, so please heed my advice about asking for a letter early.\nIf I say \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo;, please do not take it personally. I get multiple requests for recommendations and letters each semester, and I need to prioritize students that I am best positioned to write about. If I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like that is you, I\u0026rsquo;ll be more than happy to help you brainstorm about who might be best to ask.\nFollowing Up Once you\u0026rsquo;ve asked, and I\u0026rsquo;ve said \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;, please follow-up as deadlines approach. I do my best to get letters in before deadlines, and will reach out as I submit letters on your behalf to let you know about my progress. However, it is in your best interest to reach out if you have not heard from me and a deadline is approaching. Please don\u0026rsquo;t feel shy about reaching out.\nLikewise, if you get one of the positions I\u0026rsquo;ve written a letter for, let me know! It is always gratifying to hear about your successes, so please reach out with the good news!\n","date":1597122000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629435600,"objectID":"0d8d5faa673cc3ba234bf95544e51c6c","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_letters/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/docs/resources_letters/","section":"docs","summary":"Letters of recommendation, or references more generally, are an important part of many internship, job, and graduate school applications.

So, if you\u0026rsquo;ve had questions about what office hours are or when to come, you are not alone!\nWhat Office Hours Are I\u0026rsquo;ll start with what I think we (professors) think is obvious but in practice is not always - office hours are for you! This is time we reserve each week for students to drop by, get help, or just catch up. I may spend the time doing work if I\u0026rsquo;m not meeting with students, but its work I am happy (and able) to stop if you want to chat. So, if you come to my office (or to the lab where I sometimes hold office hours), you are definitely not interrupting. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;d rather talk to you then do work. Getting to know students is part of my job, and one that I particularly enjoy.\nWhen to Come Most students are not a weekly presence at office hours, so the next real question is when you should come. To some degree this depends on your goal. If you want to stop by and talk about a specific assignment or grade, it helps to come as soon as you\u0026rsquo;ve received your grade. If you want to talk about studying for quizzes, try to come a couple of weeks before an quiz rather than right before it - that will give you time to alter any study practices based on our conversation. The same is true if you want to proactively address an assignment - don\u0026rsquo;t come right before it is due, but rather a couple weeks out!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s OK to Just Chat You don\u0026rsquo;t need an excuse to come to office hours beyond wanting to talk, though. Getting to know faculty is important, even when you are a first year student. We can help you pick classes, think about study abroad, find internships, or just talk about survival strategies if that is what you need. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need us for some of those things - letters of recommendation are sometimes needed for study abroad, and often needed for things like internships, graduate school, and medical school. It is much, much harder to write letters that are convincing and compelling if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the student well, and I may say no to students if I don\u0026rsquo;t know them outside of the classroom. Lay the foundation for this early - come back and check in - you don\u0026rsquo;t need to stay long.\nThey Aren\u0026rsquo;t Just for Current Students You also don\u0026rsquo;t have to be in a class with me that semester to come by - I love catching up with students from previous semesters. Come back and tell me how your semester abroad, your summer touring with the Dead, or your sweet data science internship turned out!\nVirtual Office Hours For the 2021-2022 academic year, appointments are available for an hour and a half each week from 9am CST to 10:30am CST on Wednesdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my Calendly page. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you\u0026rsquo;ll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link.\nIf these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time!

Here are some general thoughts on maximizing your changes for success.\nGet Everything Together When I give advice, I assume that students have been taking notes on the readings, lectures, and documentaries. I think this is the single best things you can do to maximize your chances for success on my exams. When it is time to start studying, I recommend synthesizing everything. That is, taking all of your notes on a particular topic (like \u0026ldquo;Culture\u0026rdquo;) and combining them together into a single study guide for each major heading on the syllabus.\nFocus on major headings and keywords from chapters and lectures, as well as the names that show up in readings and during class. The highest probability questions come from topics that appear in both the readings and the lectures, though I\u0026rsquo;ll pull a few questions from the lectures that weren\u0026rsquo;t part of a reading and vice versa. I tend to create exams that provide pretty even coverage of the lectures within each section.\nStudying for Multiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions tend to revolve around demonstrating that you know the definition of key terms or can reverse the process and identify a key term if given the definition. I sometimes test names of important sociologists directly - \u0026ldquo;which classical theorist is associated with theories related to organizations and bureaucracy?\u0026rdquo; (A: Weber). Other times I use the name as a hint or a clue regarding the correct answer. Other times I test both of these things by providing a scenario - \u0026ldquo;this particular person has been in the news - their leadership style is best represented by which of these Weberian ideal-types?\u0026rdquo;\nYou want to make sure you know, therefore, the main ideas expressed in each major topic of the course, the people that go along with them, the social theories we discuss, and the substance of really critical pieces of evidence (I might ask, for example, about the essential details from a documentary, case study, or illustrative example we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed in class). Often, questions related to this final point are pretty general and if you read between the lines, you can zero in on the correct answer if you think about the major themes at play even if you can\u0026rsquo;t remember the specific example the question asks about.\nHow do Course Docs fit in? Starting with the Fall 2019 semester, I\u0026rsquo;ve begun posting materials here in the Course Docs. These are experimental, and will not necessarily be available for all weeks of my intro course. The intent of these is not to re-hash or cover course material, but rather to take you further if you want to learn more. This means I will not be directly testing the content of these pages. However, reading through them and using them as a jumping off point will help you learn the course material in a more thorough way. You should absolutely be able to be successful without them, of course, but you will be more confident in your mastery of the course material itself with them.\nQuiz Day For this course, quizzes happen via Canvas. They\u0026rsquo;re all multiple choice, and you can start the quiz at any time between 7:00AM CST and 10:00PM CST. Once you start the quiz, you have forty-five minutes to answer thirty questions. Since you\u0026rsquo;re not taking this in the classroom, it would be silly to try and tell you not to use outside resources. That said, you don\u0026rsquo;t have a ton of time for the quiz. Get yourself organized - if you\u0026rsquo;ve studied and worked on those guides that I describe above, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a much easier time taking the quiz. Conversely, if you try to Google your way through the quiz or rummage through class and reading notes, it is going to be a tough quiz to finish. Please do not close your computer, let it go to sleep, or let it get disconnected from the internet. If you run into technical issues with Canvas, or get disconnected from the quiz, please email me right away. However, because I cannot be equally available and responsive during the fifteen hour period when the quiz is open, I cannot answer substantive questions over email.\n","date":1597122000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629435600,"objectID":"05a618ebc1798590f8cc0b7ed54f5206","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_quizzes/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/docs/resources_quizzes/","section":"docs","summary":"I get a lot of questions, particularly from first year students, about the best ways to study for my exams.

Below are some tips for surviving in this brave new world you\u0026rsquo;ve found yourself in!\nWhat to Call Us If you\u0026rsquo;re coming from high school, you\u0026rsquo;re probably used to calling your teachers \u0026ldquo;Mrs.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Mr.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Miss.\u0026rdquo;. This is not the approach you should take with professors. Universities have an elaborate division of labor, and faculty often (but not always) have doctorates. The honorifics we use reflect this, and you want to make sure you get this right.\nAlways, always, always call faculty you haven\u0026rsquo;t met before \u0026ldquo;Doctor\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Professor.\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure if your professor has a doctorate or not, feel free to use \u0026ldquo;Professor.\u0026rdquo; Better to over-assume their credentials and have them correct you than the opposite. If you\u0026rsquo;re cold calling or emailing someone, assume that they prefer to use \u0026ldquo;Doctor\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Professor.\u0026rdquo; The same is true if faculty do not tell you what to call them on the first day of class - it is better to be overly polite than it is to take an informal approach.\nYou can look for clues in how we sign our emails. If a professor signs with their first name, this is typically invitation to respond using their first name as well. If a professor signs their emails with initials, it\u0026rsquo;s best to stick with \u0026ldquo;Doctor\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Professor\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;Dr.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;Prof\u0026rdquo;).\nSome professors are OK with students using their first name (I let my students call me Chris, for example). However, even if a professor says it is OK to use their first name, it is also totally fine to continue to use honorifics with them.\nThis can all seem a bit petty, but it\u0026rsquo;s an important exercise in acknowledging the division of labor you\u0026rsquo;re a part of. This is especially true for faculty from groups typically underrepresented in academia (women in many disciplines, and faculty from racial and ethnic minority groups). Their expertise is unfortunately questioned or ignored, and using honorifics signals that you acknowledge that expertise in a small but meaningful way.\nWriting Emails Many of the interactions you\u0026rsquo;ll have with faculty are going to be over email, so it is worth taking just a bit of time to put some thought into how you do that. First, always use your university email account. This will clearly identify who you are in a way that a gmail account may not (\u0026ldquo;skibum02@gmail.com\u0026rdquo;, for example). Second, when you start the email, make sure you get the honorific right (see above) and make sure you spell our names correctly. Beyond that, I love the tips in this fantastic medium post for putting together an effective email to professors (or really anyone) - follow them all!\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re on the subject, it is also important to remember that this is the way the University and faculty are going to communicate with you. You need to check your email daily!\nShow Us the Love We\u0026rsquo;re humans, too (I swear), and that means we have egos, sensitivities, and even feelings from time to time. While deep down we know that you have multiple priorities and our class may not always be at the top of your list, you also don\u0026rsquo;t need to rub it in. In particular, you want to avoid telegraphing to professors that you are only taking the class for a requirement, or because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet on Fridays (a game I played in college). There are some professors who might be OK with hearing this, but I\u0026rsquo;d say we\u0026rsquo;re in the minority and it is better to assume that it won\u0026rsquo;t be taken well.\nRemember There Are Many of You Most of you will have somewhere between four and six professors each semester. In contrast, I typically have 50-100 students in a given semester here at SLU. I find that students often either (a) forgot that this imbalance exists or (b) assume that because this imbalance exists, we don\u0026rsquo;t have time. Nothing could be further from the truth - we\u0026rsquo;ll always make time for your email or meeting, but just need you to remember the imbalance and be patient with us.\nAnother thing that students often don\u0026rsquo;t understand is that teaching is only part of our job. We also are expected to be actively engaged with research and writing during the semester, and be involved with what we call service (typically helping our Department, College, or discipline run). Again, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we aren\u0026rsquo;t able to help or don\u0026rsquo;t want to help, but that we may not be at our desk every day or have availability certain times of the week.\nFollow Through, But Admit When You Can\u0026rsquo;t Another part of showing us the love is following through. If you say you\u0026rsquo;re going to come to office hours, come! If you volunteer to help with some research, make sure you fulfill your end of the arrangement you make with us. If you cannot follow through, a quick email saying something came up goes a long way. Students sometimes drop off the radar, and its much better to be upfront with us about whatever change or challenge has come up.\nKeep Yourself Organized Time management is a skill that I see a lot of students struggle with (and that I struggled with in college). Dartmouth has a great set of resources for managing yourself, getting and staying organized, and using a calendar. This is especially important because most professors will tell you that they\u0026rsquo;re going to treat you like an adult - our job isn\u0026rsquo;t to nag you, make you come to class, or check in constantly. This is a bit different than the role that teachers in high school fulfill. If you decide you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do an assignment, or come to class, ultimately we\u0026rsquo;ll let you make those decisions and we\u0026rsquo;ll expect you to understand that there may be consequences (typically in the form of grades that cannot be revised or changed).\nSo, keeping yourself organized is critical to being successful! Whatever you do does not need to be elaborate or technologically sophisticated - a pad that you use to write down what you need to accomplish each day and a simple calendar can be enough. The importat thing is to start early with good organization habits.\nCommunicate Ahead of Time One of the biggest mistakes students make is that they wait until it is too late to ask for help or extensions. Almost all the faculty I know, including myself, would rather have these discussions as soon as you know there is an issue. I will bend over backwards to help students if I can, but I also need to know that there is a need out there that needs to be addressed. This is particularly important because of what I said above about there being many of you - sometimes we need a day or two to follow-up, and so communicating ahead of time helps us help you just a bit more effectively and efficiently.\nTake Care of Yourself For many of you, this is your first time out on your own. We\u0026rsquo;re all going to treat you like an adult. When we say that in this context, we mean that if you want to stay up all night, only eat ice cream, and nap during the afternoon, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to stand in your way. While it is fun to exercise some new forms of autonomy, it can also be easy to get sucked into habits that ultimately are destructive. Similarly, it can be easy to float or disengage from things like school work. While you should absolutely have fun, cut loose, and enjoy being out on your own, you should also start working now on self care and stress management. You will need these skills to be successful here, and you will have a lot more fun if you are not constantly under the burdens of stress, anxiety, or depression.\nAsk for Help If you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure exactly how to deal with stress, depression, anxiety, or another problem, please ask us for help (we\u0026rsquo;ve been there, trust me). If you need immediate help, SLU\u0026rsquo;s University Counseling Center can be reached at 314-977-TALK. There are also a host of resources both within SLU and outside of SLU that are at your disposal. If whatever is going on in your life is going to impact your school work, you also need to talk to your professors. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to give us all the details, but we need to at least know that you\u0026rsquo;re facing some challenges. We may have to check in with the University about some of this, so know that what you tell us may not be able to be kept just between us. But please, if you find yourself underwater or struggling, ask someone for help. We want you to be happy and successful!\n","date":1597122000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629435600,"objectID":"b44e0938c40f3da5c329b2343450514c","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_little-things/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/docs/resources_little-things/","section":"docs","summary":"Settling into college can be daunting - there are a host of new relationships to navigate (roommates, advisers, faculty) and a whole new set of social and cultural norms to follow and occasionally break.","tags":null,"title":"Doing the Little Things Right","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What is Canvas? Canvas is what we call a \u0026ldquo;learning management system.\u0026rdquo; It provides a platform for online teaching, and we use it for face-to-face courses as well.\nHow Do I Use Canvas? Go to the SLU Canvas login page. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials when you login. On the landing page, look for TBD.\nGetting Around Canvas TBD\nNetiquette Considerations Netiquette is a set of cultural norms (we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss these this semester!) for interacting with classmates online. Different professors might have slightly different ideas about what is appropriate, so don\u0026rsquo;t assume that everything below applies to all classes. These are adapted from Colorado State\u0026rsquo;s guide to online discussions and also include some of SLU\u0026rsquo;s best practices.\n Not all of these apply to how we\u0026rsquo;ll be using Canvas for this course, but they\u0026rsquo;re solid best practices to follow and so I like to share them anyway!    Report Glitches: Like all software, sometimes Canvas doesn\u0026rsquo;t work right. If for any reason you experience difficulty participating, please call, email, or otherwise inform me of the issue. Chances are others are having the same problem. Help Others: You may have more experience with online discussion forums than the person next to you. Give them a hand. Show them it’s not so hard. They’re really going to appreciate it! Be Patient: Read everything in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something someone else has already contributed. Acknowledge the points made with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don’t. Be Brief: You want to be clear—and to articulate your point—without being preachy or pompous. Be direct. Stay on point. Don’t lose yourself, or your readers, in overly wordy sentences or paragraphs. Write Well: Feel free to be a bit less formal than you would in a paper (contractions are fine), but make sure your work is easy to read. This means correct spelling, grammatical construction and sentence structure are expected. Cite Your Sources: Another big must! If your contribution to the conversation includes the intellectual property (authored material) of others, e.g., books, newspaper, magazine, or journal articles—online or in print—they must be given proper attribution. Use hyperlinks to reference anything online. Emojis: I differ from many of my colleagues here. Use them if you want! Respect Diversity: Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor. Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc. Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot. Remember We Can\u0026rsquo;t See You: Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm; without the context of facial expressions or other body language, your tone or intent could be missed or misunderstood by others. Respect Others' Time: Respect others’ time and life circumstances, which often don’t allow for an immediate response to a question or comment. No Yelling: Step carefully. Beware the electronic footprint you leave behind. Using bold upper-case letters is bad form, like stomping around and yelling at somebody No Flaming: Criticism must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. Please, no tantrums. Rants directed at any other contributor are simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The same goes for profanity. The academic environment expects higher-order language. Remember, You Can\u0026rsquo;t Un-Ring the Bell: Language is your only tool in an online environment. Be mindful. How others perceive you will be largely—as always—up to you. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve hit the send button, you\u0026rsquo;ve rung the bell. Review and Revise: Review your written posts and responses to ensure that you’ve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice your proofreading, revision, and rewriting skills—valuable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing. I try read my posts out loud. This helps me ensure that grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and my post is clear.

Give them a quick read anyway, because some parts will apply to office hours even if we are meeting face to face.   What is Zoom? Zoom is video conferencing software that we\u0026rsquo;ll be using this semester for class meetings and office hours.\nHow Do I Access Zoom? Links to both will be provided through our course Blackboard site. If you have your own Zoom account that is separate from your SLU account, you must use your SLU account. Our Zoom meetings require this. Please make sure you sign-out of your personal Zoom account before trying to access course meetings and office hours. I strongly encourage you to access our class meetings via a laptop or desktop computer. You should download the Zoom Client for Meetings. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials, so give yourself time before class or an office hours appointment starts. If you need to access Zoom another way, such as calling in, please let me know.\nHow Do I Login to Zoom In order to facilitate small-group discussions during class, it is important that you are signed into Zoom via SLU. In-order to ensure that you are signed-in correctly, follow the instructions below.\nAccess Zoom via the Web  Go to Zoom\u0026rsquo;s website and make sure you are signed out of any account you have. Go to mySLU Go to Tools and then click-on Zoom  Access Zoom via an App  Open your app and sign-out of any account you have. Choose Sign In with SSO Enter slu for the company domain so that it reads slu.zoom.us You will be taken to mySLU and my need to sign-in using your mySLU username and password  How Do I Use Zoom? Fortunately, using Zoom is pretty straightforward once you\u0026rsquo;ve become used it. There are only a few controls you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know how to use. The most important are how to turn your audio and video on and off. I\u0026rsquo;ll ask you for \u0026ldquo;nonverbal feedback\u0026rdquo; sometimes - these options include raising your hand, saying \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, and an option to ask me to slow down.\nThere is also a chat feature we\u0026rsquo;ll be using. When it, though, remember that your course-related communications to the instructor or other students should be considered “professional” (they are not like texts to your friends). Zoom records chats and I can view them, so please keep that in mind as well.\nWhat is the Best Way to Arrange my Zoom Meeting? I strongly recommend that you use Zoom\u0026rsquo;s side-by-side mode for screen sharing. When you are in side-by-side mode, choosing \u0026ldquo;Speaker View\u0026rdquo; will limit the number of webcams you see to just the person speaking. This arrangement allows you to see both my slides and me at the same time, and can be adjusted with your mouse to make the slides smaller or larger.\nDo I Have To Use My Microphone? When you come to class, please mute your microphone. If I call on you and you\u0026rsquo;ve raised your hand, please remember to un-mute yourself before speaking!\nDo I Have To Use My Camera? During lectures, you are not required to have your camera on - it is entirely up to you. I personally appreciate seeing a few students' faces while I teach, so if you want to leave your camera on, you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing me a favor! But like I said, it isn\u0026rsquo;t required for lectures. However, when we use the \u0026ldquo;breakout room\u0026rdquo; feature for small group discussions, you are expected to have your camera on. These discussions will occur regularly during class meetings, so please keep that in mind as you get ready and prepare your work space before class.\nWhat If I Am Having Technical Issues? Feel free to email me at chris.prener@slu.edu. If it is during class, I may not respond right away. That is why we record course meetings, however. If you find that my video or audio is not working well, please let me know in the chat!\nOther Considerations The following are Saint Louis University\u0026rsquo;s best practices for using Zoom:\n Mute your microphone when you are not speaking. Remember to “un-mute” yourself just prior to speaking. Identify yourself when you begin speaking. Expect a few seconds of delay in getting a response from the instructor or another class member to a question; wait before repeating your question or assuming it was not heard. If possible, position your camera such that your video feed does not capture too much of your surroundings or other activity/sound from your home/location. Be conscious of posters, art, or other surroundings that others might find offensive or inappropriate for an educational context. Use the “Raise Hand” and “Chat” (or similar) features of. This limits verbal interruptions and the confusion generated when multiple people try to speak at once. Just as in an on-ground, face-to-face class, limit side conversations, multi-tasking (on your computer or otherwise), and use of your cellphone. Temporarily turn off your video feed and mute your microphone when engaged in any non-class conversation or activity. Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor. Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc. Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot. Remember that video-based class sessions (including chat transcripts) may be recorded and retrieved for later viewing.

Here are a couple of tips for maximizing your rate of success when it comes to social science writing.\nMake a Plan Write an outline - it can just be a few bullet points on a sheet of paper to start. Particularly for students coming from the world of lab sciences, where lab notes have structure to them, even a short writing assignment where you open up a blank document can be daunting. So don\u0026rsquo;t open up that blank document without a plan! Start with bullet points, then add in main ideas and supporting evidence. Work yourself towards a paragraph by paragraph or (for longer assignments) a section by section plan for approaching writing.\nInclude a Road-map in Your Intro Introductions are hard to write, and some folks recommend that you write it at the end so that you can convincingly lay out what you actually did (as opposed to what you thought you\u0026rsquo;d do but didn\u0026rsquo;t end up doing). No matter when you write it, make sure you have a clear road-map for your paper - tell your audience (so, me!) what you intend to show in your paper.\nHave An Argument Another place introductions go awry is that they don\u0026rsquo;t actually take a stand. What is the point of your paper? What are you trying to illustrate or convince your audience (so, me!) of?\nBut Avoid Hyperbole That said, having an over-the-top argument is just as bad. It is a good idea to avoid saying things like \u0026ldquo;the most severe problem in America\u0026rdquo; because I will inevitably write back that this might not actually be the case. You want to be a bit circumspect with your language without being unclear - this is a practice that takes time to develop.\nBe Succinct and Organized One common thing I see with undergraduate writing is that it can\u0026hellip; ramble. I think that having a plan (see above) can help address this to some degree. One way to avoid this is to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re aggressively using paragraph breaks. Your paragraph should not run for a full page, and your sentences need to be well organized, too (none of us are William Faulkner, right?!). You want each paragraph to have a point, and want to make sure it is working in the service of your larger argument. Your paragraphs need to flow from one to the other (we call these \u0026ldquo;transitions\u0026rdquo;), and writing good transitions is hard.\nAvoid Contractions One of the most common pieces of feedback I give, aside from the need for more paragraph breaks, is to write out \u0026ldquo;do not\u0026rdquo; instead of saying \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; Why? Using contractions can convey an informal sense to your readers, and you want to avoid doing that.\nLearn Grammar Rules For example, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; (but don\u0026rsquo;t worry about \u0026ldquo;they\u0026rsquo;re\u0026rdquo;, because you\u0026rsquo;re avoiding contractions, right?). Here is a great rundown of some common grammar mistakes to avoid.\nWrite Actively Professors strongly dislike writing that uses passive voice. Make sure you work on spotting it in your own work and writing your papers in an active voice as much as you can!\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Do It The Night Before Give yourself time to proofread. Perhaps the night before is sufficient for this if you can come back to it in the morning, but the more time you give yourself for this, the better. I\u0026rsquo;ll even look at work if I\u0026rsquo;ve got enough lead time (at least a week in advance of the due date).\nIf you find you struggle with clarity, reading your work out loud can be really helpful. Its awkward, of course, so do it in a space where you\u0026rsquo;re alone (the library probably isn\u0026rsquo;t an ideal place for this exercise). Another strategy that I use for my own work is to use a tool like Grammarly. It has helped me improve my writing, and I\u0026rsquo;m an enthusiastic supporter of the platform!\nReward Yourself Writing is hard, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen all at once. This is another reason not to start the night before. Have a breakthrough or finish a hard section? Go celebrate! Get it all submitted? Celebrate some more! You worked hard and deserve a chance to give yourself a high five or a pint of ice cream. Or both.\n","date":1597122000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629435600,"objectID":"d709360aaa5b86170824429381946baa","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_writing/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/docs/resources_writing/","section":"docs","summary":"I have writing assignments in all of my classes (even my methods classes), and there are definitely patterns for where students get things right and wrong when it comes to writing assignments.","tags":null,"title":"Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bob Dylan  Bob Dylan (b. 1941) is a singer-songwriter who became an icon of 1960s counter-cultural movements, in part due to the political nature of some of his songs.

They can be virtually any size, but have a typical population of 4,000 people (so they\u0026rsquo;re often bigger in rural areas and smaller in cities). The Census Bureau has an excellent slide deck with some history and facts about the tracts.\nClassical Social Theory The \u0026ldquo;classical\u0026rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:\n  Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) - French sociologist known for his work on mental health, religion, and the division of labor  Karl Marx (1818-1883) - German philosopher, economist, and political theorist, best known for his association with communist political and economic thought  Max Weber (1864-1920) - German sociologist with wide-ranging early influence on the sociology of religion, economics, organizations, and politics  W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963) - one of the first American sociologists, known for his research on African American life  Contemporary Social Theory The \u0026ldquo;contemporary\u0026rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:\n  Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) - a Marxist political and social theorist known for his articulation of praxis in the Prison Notebooks  C. Wright Mills (1916-1962) - an American sociologist best known for his book The Sociological Imagination  Michel Foucault (1926-1984) - a French philosopher best known for his work on power and knowledge, especially regarding prisons and medicine  Patricia Hill Collins (b. 1948) - an American sociologist best known for her work on intersectionality and feminist theory  Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) - a French philosopher and sociologist best known for his work on social and cultural capital  Elizabeth Eckford  Elizabeth Eckford (b. 1941) was one of the first students to desegregate Little Rock, Arkansas\u0026rsquo;s Central High School. Known as the \u0026ldquo;Little Rock Nine\u0026rdquo;, they faced protests and the Arkansas National Guard, who were called in to bar the students from the school. President Eisenhower ultimately federalized the Arkansas National Guard and dispatched active duty soliders from the Army\u0026rsquo;s 101st Airborne Division to ensure the students were able to enter the school and attend classes. Eckford became well known because of a photo taken by journalist Will Counts on the first day of the students' effort to attend the High School. Counts\u0026rsquo;s photo of a white student named Hazel Bryan screaming at Eckford would become an iconic image. The two women briefly attempted to reconcile later in life, but ultimately found they were unable to.\nEmmett Till  Emmett Till (1941-1955) was a young men from Chicago who was savagedly beaten and then shot before his body was dumped in the Tallahatchie River near Money, MS. His murder was retribution for Till\u0026rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for The Blood of Emmett Till ( New York Times review) that the assault did not happen the way she claimed at the time. Bryant\u0026rsquo;s husband and his friend were charged with the murder and exonerated by an all white jury, but later admitted (protected by double jeopardy) that they had committed the crime. After The Blood of Emmett Till was published in 2017, the F.B.I. annouced that they were reopening the investigation into Till\u0026rsquo;s murder even though both men are now deceased. The case itself gained substantial national noteriety because Till\u0026rsquo;s mother insisted that photos of his mutiliated body be published.\nTill\u0026rsquo;s death is an example of lynching, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group. Between the end of the Civil War and the Civil Rights era, lynching was a greusome, public way of enforcing white supremacy. At least 3,446 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968. The Equal Justice Initiative\u0026rsquo;s interactive website includes a detailed report, a documentary, interviews, and an interactive map of where lynchings occured.\nHealth Care Spending The majority of data for the first \u0026ldquo;parable\u0026rdquo; were obtained via the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; Wikipedia page). There are a total of 36 member states, primarily found in Europe and the Americas; there are no member states in Africa. As a group, they serve as a proxy for the world\u0026rsquo;s most developed economies. None of the so-called BRIC developing economies (Brazi, Russia, India, and China) are a part of it, though Brazil has applied.\nThe following OECD data were used in this lecture:\n  Per capita health care spending in U.S. dollars, 2018 ( data)  Life expectancy at birth (years), 2018 ( data)  Infant mortality rates (deaths per 1,000 live births), 2018 ( data)  Gross domestic product, 2018 ( data)  All of the code used to turn these four tables into the plots we saw is available here.\nWe also looked at a graph of how the probability of an infant dying by their first birthday grows over its first year at a steeper rate in the United States than elsewhere. This graph was originally published on the Washington Post\u0026rsquo;s Wonkblog.\nGross Domestic Product  Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we\u0026rsquo;ll express GDP in per capita terms, so that we know the total dollar value per person of a given place\u0026rsquo;s economy.\nInfant Mortality Rate The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a per capita rate - the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The word \u0026ldquo;mortality\u0026rdquo; is used in place of \u0026ldquo;death\u0026rdquo; frequently in scientific discussions.\nLead Poisoning Our second \u0026ldquo;parable\u0026rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. Lead was commonly added to gasoline to improve engine efficiency and to paint to improve durability. Leaded paint was banned in 1978, lead in pipes in and solder/flux in 1986, and leaded gasoline was finally phased out in 1995, even though scientists knew throughout the 20th century that lead was highly toxic (though companies involved in lead production denied its toxicity publicly).\nIf you want to learn a bit more about Flint, Michigan\u0026rsquo;s lead crisis, both The Guardian decisions and the New York Times have reported on it (this NYT story is where the map used in the lecture came from.\nThe data shown for St. Louis were obtained from Reuters' reporting on lead poisoning. Their article includes a fascinating (if a bit terrifying) interactive map of lead poisoning rates. The map includes many, but not all, American states. The data and the code used to make the maps and plots I\u0026rsquo;ve shared are available for download.\nOther cities have struggled with this problem as well, but cost and a patchwork of laws are barriers to proactively addressing lead water lines and paint. As of August 2019, Newark is in the midst of a protracted contaminated water crisis that the city has only recently begun to acknowledge. Chicago has found high rates of lead in tap water due to contamination from lead service lines as well, and cities are working with state legislatures to allow them to proactively replace homeowners' lead water lines.\nLead posioning is an active area of scholarship as well, with recent papers reviewing our knowledge on lead posioning, documenting Flint\u0026rsquo;s water crisis, and tracing racial disparities.\nLife Expectancy When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live on average. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.\nThe Lovings Mildred Loving (d. 2008) and Richard Loving (d. 1975) were the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the State of Virgina challenging the state\u0026rsquo;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which banned interracial marriage (these were called \u0026ldquo;anti-miscegenation laws\u0026rdquo;). The Lovings had been charged under this statute in 1958, and subsequently sued Virginia. Their lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Loving v. Virginia (1968) that these laws violated the U.S. Constitution\u0026rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause, a part of the 14th Amendment.\nNorman Rockwell  Norman Rockwell (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of The Saturday Evening Post. We discussed two of his paintings - Saying Grace (1951) and The Problem We all Live With (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting Ruby Bridges to elementary school in New Orleans during that city\u0026rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the Norman Rockwell Museum, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.\nPer Capita Statistics The term \u0026ldquo;per capita\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;per person.\u0026rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using OECD data). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more per person, but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we\u0026rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We\u0026rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.\nRates Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we\u0026rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare infant mortality across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using infant mortality rate. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.\nRates Per Capita In order to compare rates across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize per capita statistics. When we calculate a \u0026ldquo;rate per capita\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;per capita rate,\u0026rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate infant mortality rate by multiplying a given entity\u0026rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city\u0026rsquo;s or state\u0026rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.\nRuby Bridges  Ruby Bridges (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in Norman Rockwell\u0026rsquo;s 1964 painting The Problem We all Live With. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.\nThe Stroke Belt The third parable for this week was about America\u0026rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and I\u0026rsquo;ve shared the maps and the code used to make them. The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by Maria Glymour, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both race and childhood poverty. Glymour\u0026rsquo;s work has also found elevated risk for individuals who are born in these states as well as individuals who live in them during adulthood. However, there is still quite a bit we don\u0026rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where rates are lower).\nThe Vietnam War A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict on Wikipedia and a more in-depth introduction with Ken Burn\u0026rsquo;s 2017 documentary The Vietnam War. I also recommend reading Tim O\u0026rsquo;Brien\u0026rsquo;s books for an infantry soldier\u0026rsquo;s literary perspective, and watching The Fog of War for a political perspective on Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C. is a striking and sobering part of our National Parks system. If you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to D.C., there is a full scale replica just an hour and a half south of St. Louis at Missouri\u0026rsquo;s National Veterans Memorial in Perryville, MO.\nOther People We also briefly mentioned the following people:\n President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969), the 34th President of the United States as well as a retired Army General and former NATO commander President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), the 35th President of the United States as well as a former Congressmen and Senator for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts President Jimmy Carter (b. 1924), the 39th President of the United States, whose 1976 convention speech quoted Bob Dylan\u0026rsquo;s song \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Alright Ma (I\u0026rsquo;m Only Bleeding)\u0026rdquo; Arkansas Gov. George Wallace (1919-1998), a segregationist who challenged LBJ in the 1964 Democratic primary (among other unsuccessful Presidential runs) Chef, author, and travel documentary maker Anthony Bourdian (1956-2018) Civil rights leader Malcom X (1925-1965), an outspoken activist in the Nation of Islam who was murdered by three members of the Nation in 1965 after publicly feuding with its leadership Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., whose legacy as a non-violent protester (think not just of Selma but also the 1963 \u0026ldquo;I Have a Dream\u0026rdquo; speech) belies the harsh, direct criticism King made of segregation, inequality, and American militarism  Lee Harvey Oswald (1939-1963), assassinated President Kennedy and murdered Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), mentioned here for her well-known denial of society\u0026rsquo;s importance in a 1987 interview  Other Topics We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:\n  Gab, an alt-right social media platform  Healthy People 2020, a Federal government campaign to improve population health The Birmingham Campaign, the 1963 effort to effect change in one of America\u0026rsquo;s most segregated cities The Cuban Missle Crisis (1962) The Civil Rights Act (1964) The Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, a campaign sparked by Rosa Park\u0026rsquo;s arrest to force desegregation of the city\u0026rsquo;s public transportation system The Selma Marches in 1965, which gained national attention due to the brutal beating of marchers by Alabama State Police officers The Voting Rights Act (1965), which created nationwide protections to ensure all Americans could vote regardless of racial identity The Watts riots (1965), which were sparked after Los Angeles Police stopped and questioned a young African American man. A fight broke out at the scene, and wild rumors spread quickly that lead to widespready violece breaking out.
