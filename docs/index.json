Like last semester, this means we are starting another semester with what feel like novel questions. Will social distancing requirements be relaxed at any point before May? When will we be able to get vaccinated? What happens if we get sick before we can get a shot? If this is your first semester at SLU, you probably have even more questions about starting at a new institution in the middle of a pandemic.\nUnlike last semester, I think we\u0026rsquo;re starting this semester in an even more challenging position. As I write this, it\u0026rsquo;s been over ten months now since we began practicing physical distancing and limiting activities in places outside of our home. Speaking for myself, I think I\u0026rsquo;m more tired than I\u0026rsquo;ve been. Each month that passes means I\u0026rsquo;ve spent more time without seeing friends, more time worrying, and more time holding off on doing things I love like traveling. For these reasons, I\u0026rsquo;m anticipating that this will be the most difficult semester yet.\nI suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the spring of 1919 had similar questions and concerns. I think it is worth remembering, though, that SLU turned 100 years old the year that pandemic started. Despite the 1918 flu pandemic, we\u0026rsquo;re still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we\u0026rsquo;ll get through this, just like the classes of 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923 did.\nMy goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our \u0026ldquo;new normal.\u0026rdquo; I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your Spring semesters.\nFocusing on What Matters First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we\u0026rsquo;ll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them?\nIn March, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we did not get sick last spring, and we got to see our families this past summer and fall. We are lucky in that respect. For some of you, you may have experienced quarantining in the Fall because you were exposed to someone who was ill. Perhaps you even became ill yourselves. All of this likely increases the stress of this semester - I know many of my students are anxious to avoid quarantine housing again.\nOn top of all this, we have new concerns, like being back in St. Louis away from our families again, and what 2021 will bring with new variants of COVID and vaccination. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.\nAll of this takes precedence over a semester\u0026rsquo;s worth of college classes. I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are \u0026ldquo;normal.\u0026rdquo; We can\u0026rsquo;t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it\u0026rsquo;s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.\nPractice Self Care The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - mostly running outdoors when it is nice and cycling indoors when the weather isn\u0026rsquo;t great. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I\u0026rsquo;m home. I try to make time to read for pleasure. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day.\nSome of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the Return to Campus Module provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use.\nWhat Class Will Be Like Both of my classes will meet \u0026ldquo;synchronously.\u0026rdquo; This means we have an assigned meeting time, and we\u0026rsquo;ll gather twice a week. Instead of meeting in Morrissey Hall, though, we\u0026rsquo;ll be meeting virtually using a tool called Zoom. Zoom will allow us to get exposed to course content, meet in small groups, and ask questions. It isn\u0026rsquo;t the same, of course, but I am going to do my best to make sure you get as much of the course experience that you would ordinarily receive as I can give you.\nMy decision to teach synchronously was made after reflecting on last spring, taking a class on online teaching, and then teaching synchronously this Fall. My Spring semester students overwhelmingly suggested to me that I teach synchronously, and I take feedback from students seriously. I asked my students from this past Fall the same question, and again they overwhelmingly suggested that the course should be taught synchronously.\nDetails about assignments and readings soon in the syllabus, but I wanted to give you all a quick preview of what the class materials will be like. Readings for the semester will come from one of three places:\n First, I am using a website called A Sociology Experiment instead of a regular text book. Chapters are written by leading sociologists, and cost $1 each. You\u0026rsquo;ll only pay for the chapters you need. I know that the pandemic has created financial uncertainty for many of us, and providing you excellent resources for the lowest cost possible is important to me. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to purchase a copy of Mama Might Be Better Off Dead, which retails for around $20 and is available at all the usual places you can buy books. I\u0026rsquo;ll also share some readings and documentaries that you can access for free using the Library, even if you are off-campus like I am.  We\u0026rsquo;ll be using Blackboard to access my slides and notes for each lecture, submit assignments, and take one of the three quizzes that will happen this semester. You\u0026rsquo;ll take these outside of class, and have a 15 hour period of time to take each of them (from 7:00 AM CST until 10:00 PM CST). Once you start, you\u0026rsquo;ll have 45 minutes to complete the 30 multiple choice questions. These quizzes aren\u0026rsquo;t cumulative, and make up just over 25% of your final grade.\nMost of your points this semester will therefore come from some short assignments that ask you to reflect on how sociological concepts have shaped your life (\u0026ldquo;Sociological Experiences\u0026rdquo;), create research questions based on social theory (\u0026ldquo;Theory Isn\u0026rsquo;t Dead Posts\u0026rdquo;), and reflect on the content of Mama Might Be Better Off Dead (\u0026ldquo;QHQ Papers\u0026rdquo;). Rubrics and examples will be shared via our Blackboard site for each of these assignments.\nI also expect that you will come to class. The syllabus contains all the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can\u0026rsquo;t attend classes occasionally, no worries. Recordings will be made available via Blackboard. That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. I keep track not just of who attends class, but also who is present for these interactive sessions, so I will notice if you come to class, sign-in, and leave. There will be a participation grade (just over 16% of your final grade) that reflects these interactive aspects of class.\nWhat Happens If I Get Sick? If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you\u0026rsquo;re sick but not very sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.\nWhat Office Hours Will Be Like My office hours are for you! I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you\u0026rsquo;ve never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.\nJust like class, office hours will occur over Zoom as well. There will be two periods:\n 9am-10am (by appointment only) 10am-10:45am (open)  For the appointment only period, you will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information. For the open, drop-in period, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a \u0026ldquo;waiting room.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately.\nProvisos This is my plan as of January 25th, 2021. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Blackboard regularly. I appreciate everyone\u0026rsquo;s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.\nAcknowledgements Special thanks to Dr. Amy Cooper for sharing her language and policies around COVID-19 modifications, which inspired the original version of this page published in Spring 2020.\n","date":1611529200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611529200,"objectID":"e3929e7811cae4df82f88504a7e7458b","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/covid19/","publishdate":"2021-01-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/covid19/","section":"","summary":"We\u0026rsquo;re once again facing a semester dramatically altered by our public health situation, though with both more risk (in the form of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19) and more hope (in the form of vaccines).","tags":null,"title":"CVOID-19 Pandemic - Plans for Remote Learning","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Old Town Road  This is a great example of cultural jamming, and also highlights the rich history of African American cowboys across the American West.\n","date":1600750800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600750800,"objectID":"4350dee40f1158657ef96fc7854d726b","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/lecture-09/","publishdate":"2020-09-22T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/docs/lecture-09/","section":"docs","summary":"Old Town Road  This is a great example of cultural jamming, and also highlights the rich history of African American cowboys across the American West.","tags":null,"title":"Lecture-09 - Culture","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Confederate Monuments The data we discussed about monuments to the Confederacy comes from a Southern Poverty Law Center report on Confederate Monuments. An updated version of the image on the slides is also available in the report. Among these are the schools I mentioned that are memorials to Confederate officers:\n Of the 103 public schools and three colleges named for Confederates leaders, those honoring Robert E. Lee are the most numerous (42), followed by Stonewall Jackson (15), Jefferson Davis (11), Nathan Bedford Forrest (8), P.G.T. Beauregard (7) and John Reagan (6).\n I also mentioned the ties between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Robert E. Lee Day. The same Southern Poverty Law Center report discusses these holidays that mark aspects of the Confederacy:\n The nine holidays officially observed in 2018 are: Alabama (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); Mississippi (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’ Birthday); South Carolina (Confederate Memorial Day); Texas (Confederate Heroes’ Day); Virginia (Lee-Jackson Day).\n  The other states that have Confederate holidays in their state codes are Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.\n Marking these holidays and the Civil War more generally as a war about \u0026ldquo;states' rights\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;northern aggression\u0026rdquo; is a cultural holdover from the \u0026ldquo;Lost Cause\u0026rdquo; myth. In DeKalb County, Georgia, officials have now installed a plaque next to an existing Confederate monument that provides context about the \u0026ldquo;lost cause\u0026rdquo;.\nOne way in which these stories get reified is through secondary school education that highlights certain themes at the expense of others. The New York Times recently compared two history textbooks from California and Texas to give readers a sense of how these books differ in the way they present history.\nLatino Health Paradox While Latino immigrants have better health on average, one thing the documentary for today does not get into is that Latino is an overly broad term. Recent research has found, for example, that not all Latinos in the United States have the same positive health advantages.\nOther People We also briefly mentioned the following people:\n  Gen.

There are three big resources that you\u0026rsquo;ll be using this semester to take this class:\n The first is Blackboard. If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Blackboard, it is a bit clunky but it gets the job done. We\u0026rsquo;ll be using Blackboard for getting access to course materials like slides and notes, finding recordings of lectures, taking quizzes, and making discussion board posts. The second is our syllabus, which is not yet available but I\u0026rsquo;ll update this page when it is. The syllabus contains all the course policies, due dates, readings, documentary links, and is your user guide to the class. Finally, we have this  course website that includes links to all of these materials as well as a \u0026ldquo;docs\u0026rdquo; section that has additional links to videos, news stories, biographies, and other relevant materials. These will help you get the most out of the class! I do this publicly so that I can share these resources between sections.  I do my best to provide links between these difference sources as often as possible. However, I recommend bookmarking the course website, which includes links to everything.\nHow Is the Course Organized? The course is organized into four parts:\n Thinking Like Sociologists - an introduction to the discipline of sociology, social theory, social science research methods, and the basics of what we call \u0026ldquo;social structure\u0026rdquo; - the way societies are organized Building Blocks of Society - an introduction to the key aspects of society, including culture, socioeconomic status, and gender and sexuality The Broken Heart of America - an overview of race and ethnicity in the United States, intersectionality theory, and urban social problems Course Conclusion - wrapping up the semester  Each Part has at least two \u0026ldquo;modules\u0026rdquo; - collections of lectures, readings, documentaries, and assignments. You\u0026rsquo;ll find the left-hand menu bar on Blackboard as well as in the course docs on the website are both organized by these modules. They\u0026rsquo;ll be released one at a time as we go through the semester.\nHow Do I Stay Up-to-date? First and foremost, come to class. I start every class with \u0026ldquo;front matter\u0026rdquo; that includes announcements and upcoming deadlines. I also end class with \u0026ldquo;back matter,\u0026rdquo; which reviews some of the most important announcements.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also use Blackboard\u0026rsquo;s Announcements page to send you emails about class.

At the beginning of class, I\u0026rsquo;ll ask everyone to scan a QR code that I post on-screen. You\u0026rsquo;ll need a smartphone or a tablet with a camera to do this. Here are some instructions for devices that run Apple\u0026rsquo;s iOS and Google\u0026rsquo;s Android operating systems. If you do not have a QR code reader built-in to your operating system, you will need to download a free third party application from your app store. If you do not have access to a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible.\nVirtual Office Hours We don\u0026rsquo;t always do a great job of explaining office hours to students, so I\u0026rsquo;ve put together an explainer on my website to lay out what office hours are for, when you should come, and remind you that it is OK to stop by without an agenda!\nFor the 2020-2021 academic year, there are two types of office hours that I have:\n Appointments: Appoints are available for an hour each week from 9am CST to 10am CST on Wednesdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my Calendly page. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you\u0026rsquo;ll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link. Drop-in: From 10am CST to 10:45am CST on Wednesdays, I\u0026rsquo;ll be available via Zoom for drop-in office hours. No appointment is required, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a \u0026ldquo;waiting room.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately. The link for this is available on Blackboard.  If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I\u0026rsquo;ll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.\nOther Tips In addition to my office hours explainer, I have the following articles on my website:\n \u0026ldquo;Doing the Little Things Right\u0026rdquo; - tips for surviving in this brave new world you\u0026rsquo;ve found yourself in at a university \u0026ldquo;Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences\u0026rdquo; - tips for writing in social science classes \u0026ldquo;Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences\u0026rdquo; - tips for studying for quizzes (you can ignore the bit about short answer questions, since we won\u0026rsquo;t have any this semester)  ","date":1597122000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611554400,"objectID":"28b66b8ca828eb00e27f0bfad3c495f7","permalink":"https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_other/","publishdate":"2020-08-11T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/docs/start_other/","section":"docs","summary":"Attendance As the syllabus notes, this course does have an attendance policy.

Blackboard is what we call a \u0026ldquo;learning management system.\u0026rdquo; It provides a platform for online teaching, and we use it for face-to-face courses as well.\nHow Do I Use Blackboard? Go to the SLU Blackboard login page. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials when you login. On the landing page, look for SP2021 SOC-1120-02 \u0026amp; SOC-1120-H02.\nGetting Around Blackboard You\u0026rsquo;ll be taken to the Annoucements page, and can use the left-hand menu to access different course modules. Within those modules will be content folders with links to course materials, assignment submission portals, quizzes, and discussion boards. There is also a resources section, that includes access to My Grades, where you can get an overview of points you\u0026rsquo;ve earned so far.\nNetiquette Considerations Netiquette is a set of cultural norms (we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss these this semester!) for interacting with classmates online. Different professors might have slightly different ideas about what is appropriate, so don\u0026rsquo;t assume that everything below applies to all classes. These are adapted from Colorado State\u0026rsquo;s guide to online discussions and also include some of SLU\u0026rsquo;s best practices.\n No lurking: This class requires active participation, you can\u0026rsquo;t just follow discussion board conversations. Please participate! Report Glitches: Blackboard is (kind of crappy) software. Sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work right. If for any reason you experience difficulty participating, please call, email, or otherwise inform me of the issue. Chances are others are having the same problem. Help Others: You may have more experience with online discussion forums than the person next to you. Give them a hand. Show them it’s not so hard. They’re really going to appreciate it! Be Patient: Read everything in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something someone else has already contributed. Acknowledge the points made with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don’t. Be Brief: You want to be clear—and to articulate your point—without being preachy or pompous. Be direct. Stay on point. Don’t lose yourself, or your readers, in overly wordy sentences or paragraphs. Write Well: Feel free to be a bit less formal than you would in a paper (contractions are fine), but make sure your work is easy to read. This means correct spelling, grammatical construction and sentence structure are expected. Cite Your Sources: Another big must! If your contribution to the conversation includes the intellectual property (authored material) of others, e.g., books, newspaper, magazine, or journal articles—online or in print—they must be given proper attribution. Use hyperlinks to reference anything online. Emojis: I differ from many of my colleagues here. Use them if you want! Respect Diversity: Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor. Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc. Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot. Remember We Can\u0026rsquo;t See You: Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm; without the context of facial expressions or other body language, your tone or intent could be missed or misunderstood by others. Respect Others' Time: Respect others’ time and life circumstances, which often don’t allow for an immediate response to a question or comment. No Yelling: Step carefully. Beware the electronic footprint you leave behind. Using bold upper-case letters is bad form, like stomping around and yelling at somebody No Flaming: Criticism must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. Please, no tantrums. Rants directed at any other contributor are simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The same goes for profanity. The academic environment expects higher-order language. Remember, You Can\u0026rsquo;t Un-Ring the Bell: Language is your only tool in an online environment. Be mindful. How others perceive you will be largely—as always—up to you. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve hit the send button, you\u0026rsquo;ve rung the bell. Review and Revise: Review your written posts and responses to ensure that you’ve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice your proofreading, revision, and rewriting skills—valuable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing. I try read my posts out loud. This helps me ensure that grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and my post is clear.

Zoom is video conferencing software that we\u0026rsquo;ll be using this semester for class meetings and office hours.\nHow Do I Access Zoom? Links to both will be provided through our course Blackboard site. If you have your own Zoom account that is separate from your SLU account, you must use your SLU account. Our Zoom meetings require this. Please make sure you sign-out of your personal Zoom account before trying to access course meetings and office hours. I strongly encourage you to access our class meetings via a laptop or desktop computer. You should download the Zoom Client for Meetings. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials, so give yourself time before class or an office hours appointment starts. If you need to access Zoom another way, such as calling in, please let me know.\nHow Do I Login to Zoom In order to facilitate small-group discussions during class, it is important that you are signed into Zoom via SLU. In-order to ensure that you are signed-in correctly, follow the instructions below.\nAccess Zoom via the Web  Go to Zoom\u0026rsquo;s website and make sure you are signed out of any account you have. Go to mySLU Go to Tools and then click-on Zoom  Access Zoom via an App  Open your app and sign-out of any account you have. Choose Sign In with SSO Enter slu for the company domain so that it reads slu.zoom.us You will be taken to mySLU and my need to sign-in using your mySLU username and password  How Do I Use Zoom? Fortunately, using Zoom is pretty straightforward once you\u0026rsquo;ve become used it. There are only a few controls you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know how to use. The most important are how to turn your audio and video on and off. I\u0026rsquo;ll ask you for \u0026ldquo;nonverbal feedback\u0026rdquo; sometimes - these options include raising your hand, saying \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, and an option to ask me to slow down.\nThere is also a chat feature we\u0026rsquo;ll be using. When it, though, remember that your course-related communications to the instructor or other students should be considered “professional” (they are not like texts to your friends). Zoom records chats and I can view them, so please keep that in mind as well.\nWhat is the Best Way to Arrange my Zoom Meeting? I strongly recommend that you use Zoom\u0026rsquo;s side-by-side mode for screen sharing. When you are in side-by-side mode, choosing \u0026ldquo;Speaker View\u0026rdquo; will limit the number of webcams you see to just the person speaking. This arrangement allows you to see both my slides and me at the same time, and can be adjusted with your mouse to make the slides smaller or larger.\nDo I Have To Use My Microphone? When you come to class, please mute your microphone. If I call on you and you\u0026rsquo;ve raised your hand, please remember to un-mute yourself before speaking!\nDo I Have To Use My Camera? During lectures, you are not required to have your camera on - it is entirely up to you. I personally appreciate seeing a few students' faces while I teach, so if you want to leave your camera on, you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing me a favor! But like I said, it isn\u0026rsquo;t required for lectures. However, when we use the \u0026ldquo;breakout room\u0026rdquo; feature for small group discussions, you are expected to have your camera on. These discussions will occur regularly during class meetings, so please keep that in mind as you get ready and prepare your work space before class.\nWhat If I Am Having Technical Issues? Feel free to email me at chris.prener@slu.edu. If it is during class, I may not respond right away. That is why we record course meetings, however. If you find that my video or audio is not working well, please let me know in the chat!\nOther Considerations The following are Saint Louis University\u0026rsquo;s best practices for using Zoom:\n Mute your microphone when you are not speaking. Remember to “un-mute” yourself just prior to speaking. Identify yourself when you begin speaking. Expect a few seconds of delay in getting a response from the instructor or another class member to a question; wait before repeating your question or assuming it was not heard. If possible, position your camera such that your video feed does not capture too much of your surroundings or other activity/sound from your home/location. Be conscious of posters, art, or other surroundings that others might find offensive or inappropriate for an educational context. Use the “Raise Hand” and “Chat” (or similar) features of. This limits verbal interruptions and the confusion generated when multiple people try to speak at once. Just as in an on-ground, face-to-face class, limit side conversations, multi-tasking (on your computer or otherwise), and use of your cellphone. Temporarily turn off your video feed and mute your microphone when engaged in any non-class conversation or activity. Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor. Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc. Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot. Remember that video-based class sessions (including chat transcripts) may be recorded and retrieved for later viewing.

Among his enormous body of work are a number of songs focused on the civil rights era, including \u0026ldquo; The Death of Emmett Till\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo; Only a Pawn in Their Game\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo; The Times They Are a-Changin'\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo; Blowin' in the Wind\u0026rdquo;.\nVideo - It\u0026rsquo;s Alright Ma (I\u0026rsquo;m Only Bleeding)     Lyrics  Wikipedia Page  Census Tract Census tracts are areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau for data collection and dissemination. They can be virtually any size, but have a typical population of 4,000 people (so they\u0026rsquo;re often bigger in rural areas and smaller in cities). The Census Bureau has an excellent slide deck with some history and facts about the tracts.\nClassical Social Theory The \u0026ldquo;classical\u0026rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:\n  Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) - French sociologist known for his work on mental health, religion, and the division of labor  Karl Marx (1818-1883) - German philosopher, economist, and political theorist, best known for his association with communist political and economic thought  Max Weber (1864-1920) - German sociologist with wide-ranging early influence on the sociology of religion, economics, organizations, and politics  W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-1963) - one of the first American sociologists, known for his research on African American life  Contemporary Social Theory The \u0026ldquo;contemporary\u0026rdquo; theorists we mentioned this week were:\n  Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) - a Marxist political and social theorist known for his articulation of praxis in the Prison Notebooks  C. Wright Mills (1916-1962) - an American sociologist best known for his book The Sociological Imagination  Michel Foucault (1926-1984) - a French philosopher best known for his work on power and knowledge, especially regarding prisons and medicine  Patricia Hill Collins (b. 1948) - an American sociologist best known for her work on intersectionality and feminist theory  Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) - a French philosopher and sociologist best known for his work on social and cultural capital  Elizabeth Eckford  Elizabeth Eckford (b. 1941) was one of the first students to desegregate Little Rock, Arkansas\u0026rsquo;s Central High School. Known as the \u0026ldquo;Little Rock Nine\u0026rdquo;, they faced protests and the Arkansas National Guard, who were called in to bar the students from the school. President Eisenhower ultimately federalized the Arkansas National Guard and dispatched active duty soliders from the Army\u0026rsquo;s 101st Airborne Division to ensure the students were able to enter the school and attend classes. Eckford became well known because of a photo taken by journalist Will Counts on the first day of the students' effort to attend the High School. Counts\u0026rsquo;s photo of a white student named Hazel Bryan screaming at Eckford would become an iconic image. The two women briefly attempted to reconcile later in life, but ultimately found they were unable to.\nEmmett Till  Emmett Till (1941-1955) was a young men from Chicago who was savagedly beaten and then shot before his body was dumped in the Tallahatchie River near Money, MS. His murder was retribution for Till\u0026rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for The Blood of Emmett Till ( New York Times review) that the assault did not happen the way she claimed at the time. Bryant\u0026rsquo;s husband and his friend were charged with the murder and exonerated by an all white jury, but later admitted (protected by double jeopardy) that they had committed the crime. After The Blood of Emmett Till was published in 2017, the F.B.I. annouced that they were reopening the investigation into Till\u0026rsquo;s murder even though both men are now deceased. The case itself gained substantial national noteriety because Till\u0026rsquo;s mother insisted that photos of his mutiliated body be published.\nTill\u0026rsquo;s death is an example of lynching, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group. Between the end of the Civil War and the Civil Rights era, lynching was a greusome, public way of enforcing white supremacy. At least 3,446 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968. The Equal Justice Initiative\u0026rsquo;s interactive website includes a detailed report, a documentary, interviews, and an interactive map of where lynchings occured.\nHealth Care Spending The majority of data for the first \u0026ldquo;parable\u0026rdquo; were obtained via the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; Wikipedia page). There are a total of 36 member states, primarily found in Europe and the Americas; there are no member states in Africa. As a group, they serve as a proxy for the world\u0026rsquo;s most developed economies. None of the so-called BRIC developing economies (Brazi, Russia, India, and China) are a part of it, though Brazil has applied.\nThe following OECD data were used in this lecture:\n  Per capita health care spending in U.S. dollars, 2018 ( data)  Life expectancy at birth (years), 2018 ( data)  Infant mortality rates (deaths per 1,000 live births), 2018 ( data)  Gross domestic product, 2018 ( data)  All of the code used to turn these four tables into the plots we saw is available here.\nWe also looked at a graph of how the probability of an infant dying by their first birthday grows over its first year at a steeper rate in the United States than elsewhere. This graph was originally published on the Washington Post\u0026rsquo;s Wonkblog.\nGross Domestic Product  Gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we\u0026rsquo;ll express GDP in per capita terms, so that we know the total dollar value per person of a given place\u0026rsquo;s economy.\nInfant Mortality Rate The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a per capita rate - the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The word \u0026ldquo;mortality\u0026rdquo; is used in place of \u0026ldquo;death\u0026rdquo; frequently in scientific discussions.\nLead Poisoning Our second \u0026ldquo;parable\u0026rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. Lead was commonly added to gasoline to improve engine efficiency and to paint to improve durability. Leaded paint was banned in 1978, lead in pipes in and solder/flux in 1986, and leaded gasoline was finally phased out in 1995, even though scientists knew throughout the 20th century that lead was highly toxic (though companies involved in lead production denied its toxicity publicly).\nIf you want to learn a bit more about Flint, Michigan\u0026rsquo;s lead crisis, both The Guardian decisions and the New York Times have reported on it (this NYT story is where the map used in the lecture came from.\nThe data shown for St. Louis were obtained from Reuters' reporting on lead poisoning. Their article includes a fascinating (if a bit terrifying) interactive map of lead poisoning rates. The map includes many, but not all, American states. The data and the code used to make the maps and plots I\u0026rsquo;ve shared are available for download.\nOther cities have struggled with this problem as well, but cost and a patchwork of laws are barriers to proactively addressing lead water lines and paint. As of August 2019, Newark is in the midst of a protracted contaminated water crisis that the city has only recently begun to acknowledge. Chicago has found high rates of lead in tap water due to contamination from lead service lines as well, and cities are working with state legislatures to allow them to proactively replace homeowners' lead water lines.\nLead posioning is an active area of scholarship as well, with recent papers reviewing our knowledge on lead posioning, documenting Flint\u0026rsquo;s water crisis, and tracing racial disparities.\nLife Expectancy When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live on average. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.\nThe Lovings Mildred Loving (d. 2008) and Richard Loving (d. 1975) were the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the State of Virgina challenging the state\u0026rsquo;s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which banned interracial marriage (these were called \u0026ldquo;anti-miscegenation laws\u0026rdquo;). The Lovings had been charged under this statute in 1958, and subsequently sued Virginia. Their lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Loving v. Virginia (1968) that these laws violated the U.S. Constitution\u0026rsquo;s Equal Protection Clause, a part of the 14th Amendment.\nNorman Rockwell  Norman Rockwell (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of The Saturday Evening Post. We discussed two of his paintings - Saying Grace (1951) and The Problem We all Live With (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting Ruby Bridges to elementary school in New Orleans during that city\u0026rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you\u0026rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the Norman Rockwell Museum, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.\nPer Capita Statistics The term \u0026ldquo;per capita\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;per person.\u0026rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using OECD data). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more per person, but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we\u0026rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We\u0026rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.\nRates Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we\u0026rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare infant mortality across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using infant mortality rate. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.\nRates Per Capita In order to compare rates across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize per capita statistics. When we calculate a \u0026ldquo;rate per capita\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;per capita rate,\u0026rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate infant mortality rate by multiplying a given entity\u0026rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city\u0026rsquo;s or state\u0026rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.\nRuby Bridges  Ruby Bridges (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in Norman Rockwell\u0026rsquo;s 1964 painting The Problem We all Live With. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.\nThe Stroke Belt The third parable for this week was about America\u0026rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and I\u0026rsquo;ve shared the maps and the code used to make them. The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by Maria Glymour, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both race and childhood poverty. Glymour\u0026rsquo;s work has also found elevated risk for individuals who are born in these states as well as individuals who live in them during adulthood. However, there is still quite a bit we don\u0026rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where rates are lower).\nThe Vietnam War A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict on Wikipedia and a more in-depth introduction with Ken Burn\u0026rsquo;s 2017 documentary The Vietnam War. I also recommend reading Tim O\u0026rsquo;Brien\u0026rsquo;s books for an infantry soldier\u0026rsquo;s literary perspective, and watching The Fog of War for a political perspective on Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C. is a striking and sobering part of our National Parks system. If you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to D.C., there is a full scale replica just an hour and a half south of St. Louis at Missouri\u0026rsquo;s National Veterans Memorial in Perryville, MO.\nOther People We also briefly mentioned the following people:\n President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969), the 34th President of the United States as well as a retired Army General and former NATO commander President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963), the 35th President of the United States as well as a former Congressmen and Senator for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts President Jimmy Carter (b. 1924), the 39th President of the United States, whose 1976 convention speech quoted Bob Dylan\u0026rsquo;s song \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Alright Ma (I\u0026rsquo;m Only Bleeding)\u0026rdquo; Arkansas Gov. George Wallace (1919-1998), a segregationist who challenged LBJ in the 1964 Democratic primary (among other unsuccessful Presidential runs) Chef, author, and travel documentary maker Anthony Bourdian (1956-2018) Civil rights leader Malcom X (1925-1965), an outspoken activist in the Nation of Islam who was murdered by three members of the Nation in 1965 after publicly feuding with its leadership Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., whose legacy as a non-violent protester (think not just of Selma but also the 1963 \u0026ldquo;I Have a Dream\u0026rdquo; speech) belies the harsh, direct criticism King made of segregation, inequality, and American militarism  Lee Harvey Oswald (1939-1963), assassinated President Kennedy and murdered Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), mentioned here for her well-known denial of society\u0026rsquo;s importance in a 1987 interview  Other Topics We also briefly mentioned the following concepts and historical events:\n  Gab, an alt-right social media platform  Healthy People 2020, a Federal government campaign to improve population health The Birmingham Campaign, the 1963 effort to effect change in one of America\u0026rsquo;s most segregated cities The Cuban Missle Crisis (1962) The Civil Rights Act (1964) The Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, a campaign sparked by Rosa Park\u0026rsquo;s arrest to force desegregation of the city\u0026rsquo;s public transportation system The Selma Marches in 1965, which gained national attention due to the brutal beating of marchers by Alabama State Police officers The Voting Rights Act (1965), which created nationwide protections to ensure all Americans could vote regardless of racial identity The Watts riots (1965), which were sparked after Los Angeles Police stopped and questioned a young African American man. A fight broke out at the scene, and wild rumors spread quickly that lead to widespready violece breaking out.
