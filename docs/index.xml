      <title>Getting Around SOC 1120</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-course-resources&#34;&gt;What Are the Main Course Resources?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three big resources that you&amp;rsquo;ll be using this semester to take this class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://blackboard.slu.edu&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Blackboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Blackboard, it is a bit clunky but it gets the job done. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Blackboard for getting access to course materials like slides and notes, finding recordings of lectures, taking quizzes, and making discussion board posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second is our &lt;strong&gt;syllabus,&lt;/strong&gt; which is not yet available but I&amp;rsquo;ll update this page when it is. The syllabus contains all the course policies, due dates, readings, documentary links, and is your user guide to the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we have this &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://slu-soc1120.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that includes links to all of these materials as well as a &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; section that has additional links to videos, news stories, biographies, and other relevant materials. These will help you get the most out of the class! I do this publicly so that I can share these resources between sections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do my best to provide links between these difference sources as often as possible. However, I recommend bookmarking the course website, which includes links to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-course-organized&#34;&gt;How Is the Course Organized?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is organized into four parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking Like Sociologists - an introduction to the discipline of sociology, social theory, social science research methods, and the basics of what we call &amp;ldquo;social structure&amp;rdquo; - the way societies are organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Blocks of Society - an introduction to the key aspects of society, including culture, socioeconomic status, and gender and sexuality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Broken Heart of America - an overview of race and ethnicity in the United States, intersectionality theory, and urban social problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course Conclusion - wrapping up the semester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Part has at least two &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; - collections of lectures, readings, documentaries, and assignments. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the left-hand menu bar on Blackboard as well as in the course docs on the website are both organized by these modules. They&amp;rsquo;ll be released one at a time as we go through the semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-stay-up-to-date&#34;&gt;How Do I Stay Up-to-date?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, come to class. I start every class with &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo; that includes announcements and upcoming deadlines. I also end class with &amp;ldquo;back matter,&amp;rdquo; which reviews some of the most important announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also use Blackboard&amp;rsquo;s Announcements page to send you emails about class. This means you &lt;em&gt;need to check your email regularly.&lt;/em&gt; This means every day, multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;attendance&#34;&gt;Attendance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the syllabus notes, this course does have an attendance policy. At the beginning of class, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask everyone to scan a &lt;a href = &#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;QR code&lt;/a&gt; that I post on-screen. You&amp;rsquo;ll need a smartphone or a tablet with a camera to do this. Here are some instructions for devices that run &lt;a href = &#34;https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-ios/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href = &#34;https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-android/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Android&lt;/a&gt; operating systems. If you do not have a QR code reader built-in to your operating system, you will need to download a free third party application from your app store. &lt;strong&gt;If you do not have access to a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-office-hours&#34;&gt;Virtual Office Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t always do a great job of explaining office hours to students, so I&amp;rsquo;ve put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/office-hours/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an explainer on my website&lt;/a&gt; to lay out what office hours are for, when you should come, and remind you that it is OK to stop by without an agenda!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2020-2021 academic year, there are two types of office hours that I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appointments: Appoints are available for an hour each week from 9am CST to 10am CST on Thursdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my &lt;a href = &#34;https://calendly.com/chris-prener&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Calendly page&lt;/a&gt;. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop-in: From 10am CST to 10:45am CST on Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ll be available via Zoom for drop-in office hours. No appointment is required, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a &amp;ldquo;waiting room.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately. The link for this is available on Blackboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I&amp;rsquo;ll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-tips&#34;&gt;Other Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/office-hours/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;office hours explainer&lt;/a&gt;, I have the following articles on my website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/little-things/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Doing the Little Things Right&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; - tips for surviving in this brave new world you&amp;rsquo;ve found yourself in at a university&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/writing/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; - tips for writing in social science classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chris-prener.github.io/resources/students/exams/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; - tips for studying for quizzes (you can ignore the bit about short answer questions, since we won&amp;rsquo;t have any this semester)&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Tips for Using Blackboard</title>
      <link>/docs/start_blackboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>/docs/start_blackboard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-blackboard&#34;&gt;What is Blackboard?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blackboard&lt;/strong&gt; is what we call a &amp;ldquo;learning management system.&amp;rdquo; It provides a platform for online teaching, and we use it for face-to-face courses as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-use-blackboard&#34;&gt;How Do I Use Blackboard?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href = &#34;http://blackboard.slu.edu&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the SLU Blackboard login page&lt;/a&gt;. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials when you login. On the landing page, look for either &lt;code&gt;FL2020 SOC-1120-01-Introduction to Sociology: Diversity and Health Emphasis&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FL2020 SOC-1120-05 &amp;amp; SOC-1120-H05&lt;/code&gt; depending on which section you are enrolled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-around-blackboard&#34;&gt;Getting Around Blackboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll be taken to the &lt;code&gt;Annoucements&lt;/code&gt; page, and can use the left-hand menu to access different course modules. Within those modules will be content folders with links to course materials, assignment submission portals, quizzes, and discussion boards. There is also a resources section, that includes access to &lt;code&gt;My Grades&lt;/code&gt;, where you can get an overview of points you&amp;rsquo;ve earned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;netiquette-considerations&#34;&gt;Netiquette Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netiquette is a set of cultural norms (we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss these this semester!) for interacting with classmates online. Different professors might have slightly different ideas about what is appropriate, so don&amp;rsquo;t assume that everything below applies to all classes. These are adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tilt.colostate.edu/TipsAndGuides/Tip/128&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Colorado State&amp;rsquo;s guide to online discussions&lt;/a&gt; and also include some of SLU&amp;rsquo;s best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No lurking&lt;/strong&gt;: This class requires active participation, you can&amp;rsquo;t just follow discussion board conversations. Please participate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report Glitches&lt;/strong&gt;: Blackboard is (kind of crappy) software. Sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work right. If for any reason you experience difficulty participating, please call, email, or otherwise inform me of the issue. Chances are others are having the same problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help Others&lt;/strong&gt;: You may have more experience with online discussion forums than the person next to you. Give them a hand. Show them it’s not so hard. They’re really going to appreciate it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Patient&lt;/strong&gt;: Read everything in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something someone else has already contributed. Acknowledge the points made with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Brief&lt;/strong&gt;: You want to be clear—and to articulate your point—without being preachy or pompous. Be direct. Stay on point. Don’t lose yourself, or your readers, in overly wordy sentences or paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write Well&lt;/strong&gt;: Feel free to be a bit less formal than you would in a paper (contractions are fine), but make sure your work is easy to read. This means correct spelling, grammatical construction and sentence structure are expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cite Your Sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Another big must! If your contribution to the conversation includes the intellectual property (authored material) of others, e.g., books, newspaper, magazine, or journal articles—online or in print—they must be given proper attribution. Use hyperlinks to reference anything online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emojis&lt;/strong&gt;: I differ from many of my colleagues here. Use them if you want!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Diversity&lt;/strong&gt;: Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor.  Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc.  Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember We Can&amp;rsquo;t See You&lt;/strong&gt;: Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm; without the context of facial expressions or other body language, your tone or intent could be missed or misunderstood by others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Others&amp;rsquo; Time&lt;/strong&gt;: Respect others’ time and life circumstances, which often don’t allow for an immediate response to a question or comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Yelling&lt;/strong&gt;: Step carefully. Beware the electronic footprint you leave behind. Using bold upper-case letters is bad form, like stomping around and yelling at somebody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Flaming&lt;/strong&gt;: Criticism must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. Please, no tantrums. Rants directed at any other contributor are simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The same goes for profanity. The academic environment expects higher-order language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, You Can&amp;rsquo;t Un-Ring the Bell&lt;/strong&gt;: Language is your only tool in an online environment. Be mindful. How others perceive you will be largely—as always—up to you. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve hit the send button, you&amp;rsquo;ve rung the bell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review and Revise&lt;/strong&gt;: Review your written posts and responses to ensure that you’ve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice your proofreading, revision, and rewriting skills—valuable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing. I try read my posts out loud. This helps me ensure that grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and my post is clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Tips for Using Zoom</title>
      <link>/docs/start_zoom/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>/docs/start_zoom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zoom&#34;&gt;What is Zoom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom&lt;/strong&gt; is video conferencing software that we&amp;rsquo;ll be using this semester for class meetings and office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-access-zoom&#34;&gt;How Do I Access Zoom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to both will be provided through our course Blackboard site. If you have your own Zoom account that is separate from your SLU account, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; use your SLU account. Our Zoom meetings require this. Please make sure you sign-out of your personal Zoom account before trying to access course meetings and office hours. I strongly encourage you to access our class meetings via a laptop or desktop computer. You should download the &lt;a href = &#34;https://zoom.us/download&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Zoom Client for Meetings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials, so give yourself time before class or an office hours appointment starts. If you need to access Zoom another way, such as calling in, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-use-zoom&#34;&gt;How Do I Use Zoom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, using Zoom is pretty straightforward once you&amp;rsquo;ve become used it. There are only a few controls you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know how to use. The most important are how to &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/200941109-Attendee-controls-in-a-meeting&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;turn your audio and video on and off&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-feedback-during-meetings&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;nonverbal feedback&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; sometimes - these options include raising your hand, saying &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, and an option to ask me to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203650445-In-meeting-chat&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chat feature&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ll be using. When it, though, remember that your course-related communications to the instructor or other students should be considered “professional” (they are not like texts to your friends).  Zoom records chats and I can view them, so please keep that in mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-best-way-to-arrange-my-zoom-meeting&#34;&gt;What is the Best Way to Arrange my Zoom Meeting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend that you use Zoom&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004802843-Side-by-side-Mode-for-screen-sharing&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;side-by-side mode&lt;/a&gt; for screen sharing. When you are in side-by-side mode, choosing &amp;ldquo;Speaker View&amp;rdquo; will limit the number of webcams you see to just the person speaking. This arrangement allows you to see both my slides and me at the same time, and can be adjusted with your mouse to make the slides smaller or larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-i-have-to-use-my-microphone&#34;&gt;Do I Have To Use My Microphone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come to class, please mute your microphone. If I call on you and you&amp;rsquo;ve raised your hand, please remember to un-mute yourself before speaking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-i-have-to-use-my-camera&#34;&gt;Do I Have To Use My Camera?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lectures, you are not required to have your camera on - it is entirely up to you. I personally appreciate seeing a few students&amp;rsquo; faces while I teach, so if you want to leave your camera on, you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing me a favor! But like I said, it isn&amp;rsquo;t required for lectures. However, when we use the &amp;ldquo;breakout room&amp;rdquo; feature for small group discussions, you are expected to have your camera on. These discussions will occur regularly during class meetings, so please keep that in mind as you get ready and prepare your work space before class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-if-i-am-having-technical-issues&#34;&gt;What If I Am Having Technical Issues?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to email me at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu&#34;&gt;chris.prener@slu.edu&lt;/a&gt;. If it is during class, I may not respond right away. That is why we record course meetings, however. If you find that my video or audio is not working well, please let me know in the chat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-considerations&#34;&gt;Other Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are Saint Louis University&amp;rsquo;s best practices for using Zoom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mute your microphone when you are not speaking.  Remember to “un-mute” yourself just prior to speaking.  Identify yourself when you begin speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect a few seconds of delay in getting a response from the instructor or another class member to a question; wait before repeating your question or assuming it was not heard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, position your camera such that your video feed does not capture too much of your surroundings or other activity/sound from your home/location.  Be conscious of posters, art, or other surroundings that others might find offensive or inappropriate for an educational context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the “Raise Hand” and “Chat” (or similar) features of your video-conferencing tool.  This limits verbal interruptions and the confusion generated when multiple people try to speak at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as in an on-ground, face-to-face class, limit side conversations, multi-tasking (on your computer or otherwise), and use of your cellphone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporarily turn off your video feed and mute your microphone when engaged in any non-class conversation or activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor.  Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc.  Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that video-based class sessions (including chat transcripts) may be recorded and retrieved for later viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Census tracts are areas defined by the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt; for data collection and dissemination. They can be virtually any size, but have a typical population of 4,000 people (so they&amp;rsquo;re often bigger in rural areas and smaller in cities). The Census Bureau has an excellent

His murder was retribution for Till&amp;rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for

The case itself gained substantial national noteriety because Till&amp;rsquo;s mother insisted that photos of his mutiliated body be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till&amp;rsquo;s death is an example of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt;, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group.

&lt;p&gt;The majority of data for the first &amp;ldquo;parable&amp;rdquo; were obtained via the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; (OECD; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;). There are a total of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org/about/members-and-partners/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;36 member states&lt;/a&gt;, primarily found in Europe and the Americas; there are no member states in Africa. As a group, they serve as a proxy for the world&amp;rsquo;s most developed economies. None of the so-called BRIC developing economies (Brazi, Russia, India, and China) are a part of it, though Brazil has applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following OECD data were used in this lecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita&#34;&gt;Per capita&lt;/a&gt; health care spending in U.S. dollars, 2018 (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;Infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; (deaths per 1,000 live births), 2018 (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/infant-mortality-rates.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked at a graph of how the probability of an infant dying by their first birthday grows over its first year at a steeper rate in the United States than elsewhere. This graph was originally published on the Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/29/our-infant-mortality-rate-is-a-national-embarrassment/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wonkblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gross-domestic-product&#34;&gt;Gross Domestic Product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt;, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we&amp;rsquo;ll express GDP in 
&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita&#34;&gt;per capita&lt;/a&gt; terms, so that we know the total dollar value &lt;em&gt;per person&lt;/em&gt; of a given place&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;Infant Mortality Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a 
&lt;a href=&#34;#rates-per-capita&#34;&gt;per capita rate&lt;/a&gt; - the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The word &amp;ldquo;mortality&amp;rdquo; is used in place of &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; frequently in scientific discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lead-poisoning&#34;&gt;Lead Poisoning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second &amp;ldquo;parable&amp;rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. Lead was commonly

Leaded paint was banned in 1978, lead in pipes in and solder/flux in 1986, and leaded gasoline was finally phased out in 1995, even though 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/leaded-gas-poison-invented-180961368/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;scientists knew throughout the 20th century&lt;/a&gt; that lead was highly toxic (though companies involved in lead production denied its toxicity publicly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-expectancy&#34;&gt;Life Expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Equal Protection Clause, a part of the 14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;norman-rockwell&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/a&gt; (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Saturday Evening Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed two of his paintings - 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saying_Grace_%28Rockwell%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saying Grace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1951) and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem We all Live With&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ruby-bridges&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/a&gt; to elementary school in New Orleans during that city&amp;rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nrm.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell Museum&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;per-capita-statistics&#34;&gt;Per Capita Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;per capita&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;per person.&amp;rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using 
&lt;a href=&#34;#health-care-spending&#34;&gt;OECD data&lt;/a&gt;). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more &lt;em&gt;per person,&lt;/em&gt; but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we&amp;rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We&amp;rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rates&#34;&gt;Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we&amp;rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare 
&lt;a href=&#34;#health-care-spending&#34;&gt;infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using 
&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt;. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rates-per-capita&#34;&gt;Rates Per Capita&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to compare 
&lt;a href=&#34;#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize 
&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita-statistics&#34;&gt;per capita statistics&lt;/a&gt;. When we calculate a &amp;ldquo;rate per capita&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;per capita rate,&amp;rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate 
&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; by multiplying a given entity&amp;rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city&amp;rsquo;s or state&amp;rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruby-bridges&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Bridges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in 
&lt;a href=&#34;#norman-rockwell&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; 1964 painting 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem We all Live With&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stroke-belt&#34;&gt;The Stroke Belt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third parable for this week was about America&amp;rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/maps_data.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve shared the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slu-soc1120/US_OUTCOMES_Stroke&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;maps and the code used to make them&lt;/a&gt;. The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/maria.glymour&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Maria Glymour, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.482059&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;born in these states&lt;/a&gt; as well as individuals who

However, there is still quite a bit we don&amp;rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012997&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rates are lower&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vietnam-war&#34;&gt;The Vietnam War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict

&lt;p&gt;i. &lt;strong&gt;Share&lt;/strong&gt; means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;j. &lt;strong&gt;Sui Generis Database Rights&lt;/strong&gt; means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k. &lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt; means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-2--scope&#34;&gt;Section 2 – Scope.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License grant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions and Limitations.&lt;/strong&gt; For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term.&lt;/strong&gt; The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.&lt;/strong&gt; The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downstream recipients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;strong&gt;Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.&lt;/strong&gt; Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;strong&gt;No downstream restrictions.&lt;/strong&gt; You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No endorsement.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-3--license-conditions&#34;&gt;Section 3 – License Conditions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. a copyright notice;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&amp;rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-4--sui-generis-database-rights&#34;&gt;Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-5--disclaimer-of-warranties-and-limitation-of-liability&#34;&gt;Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-6--term-and-termination&#34;&gt;Section 6 – Term and Termination.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-7--other-terms-and-conditions&#34;&gt;Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-8--interpretation&#34;&gt;Section 8 – Interpretation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CVOID-19 Pandemic - Plans for Remote Learning</title>
      <link>/covid19/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>/covid19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are starting this semester with a ton of questions. Many of you are wondering what campus life will be like with the new social distancing requirements. You may be wondering, or even struggling with, what starting college this semester will be like. What will classes be like in-person? And what about courses that are online, like this one? How am I going to study with my friends? How will you complete assignments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reflecting this summer about how novel this all still feels. I suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the fall of 1918 had similar questions. SLU turned 100 years old that year, and despite the pandemic, we&amp;rsquo;re still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we&amp;rsquo;ll get through this, just like the classes of 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1922 did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our &amp;ldquo;new normal.&amp;rdquo; I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your fall semesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focusing-on-what-matters&#34;&gt;Focusing on What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we&amp;rsquo;ll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we did not get sick last spring, and we got to see our families this summer. Now, however, we have new concerns, like what homeschooling a precocious six year-old who should be starting Kindergarten will be like. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of this takes precedence over a semester’s worth of college classes.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are &amp;ldquo;normal.&amp;rdquo; We can’t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it’s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don’t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice-self-care&#34;&gt;Practice Self Care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - I run, cycle, and hike every week. If it is raining I lift weights in the basement. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I&amp;rsquo;m home. I try to make time to read for pleasure, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling my way through a Harry Potter puzzle all summer. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/slu.edu/covid-19fall2020preparationmod/home/part-four-encouragement-and-support&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Return to Campus Module&lt;/a&gt; provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-class-will-be-like&#34;&gt;What Class Will Be Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of my classes will meet &amp;ldquo;synchronously.&amp;rdquo; This means we have an assigned meeting time, and we&amp;rsquo;ll gather twice a week. Instead of meeting in Morrissey Hall, though, we&amp;rsquo;ll be meeting virtually using a tool called Zoom. Zoom will allow us to get exposed to course content, meet in small groups, and ask questions. It isn&amp;rsquo;t the same, of course, but I am going to do my best to make sure you get as much of the course experience that you would ordinarily receive as I can give you. My decision to teach synchronously was made after spending the summer reflecting on last spring and taking a class on online teaching. My spring semester students overwhelmingly suggested to me that I teach synchronously, and I take feedback from students seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing details about assignments and readings soon in the syllabus, but I wanted to give you all a quick preview of what the class materials will be like. Readings for the semester will come from one of three places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I am using a website called &lt;a href = &#34;https://www.sociologyexperiment.com&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A Sociology Experiment&lt;/a&gt; instead of a regular text book. Chapters are written by leading sociologists, and cost $1 each. You&amp;rsquo;ll only pay for the chapters you need. I know that the pandemic has created financial uncertainty for many of us, and providing you excellent resources for the lowest cost possible is important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to purchase a copy of &lt;a href = &#34;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo37936174.html&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mama Might Be Better Off Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which retails for around $20 and is available at all the usual places you can buy books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also share some readings and documentaries that you can access for free using the Library, even if you are off-campus like I am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Blackboard to access my slides and notes for each lecture, submit assignments, and take one of the three quizzes that will happen this semester. You&amp;rsquo;ll take these outside of class, and have a 12 hour period of time to take each of them. Once you start, you&amp;rsquo;ll have 35 minutes to complete the 30 multiple choice questions. These quizzes aren&amp;rsquo;t cumulative, and make up 25% of your final grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of your points this semester will therefore come from some short assignments that ask you to reflect on how sociological concepts have shaped your life (&amp;ldquo;Sociological Experiences&amp;rdquo;), create research questions based on social theory (&amp;ldquo;Theory Isn&amp;rsquo;t Dead Posts&amp;rdquo;), and reflect on the content of &lt;em&gt;Mama Might Be Better Off Dead&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;QHQ Papers&amp;rdquo;). Rubrics and examples will be shared via our Blackboard site for each of these assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also expect that you will come to class. The syllabus will contain the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can&amp;rsquo;t attend classes occasionally, no worries. Recordings will be made available via Blackboard. That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. There will be a participation grade (10% of your final grade) that reflects these interactive aspects of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-if-i-get-sick&#34;&gt;What Happens If I Get Sick?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you&amp;rsquo;re sick but not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-office-hours-will-be-like&#34;&gt;What Office Hours Will Be Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My office hours are for you! I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you&amp;rsquo;ve never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like class, office hours will occur over Zoom as well. There will be two periods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9am-10am (by appointment only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10am-10:45am (open)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the appointment only period, you will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information. For the open, drop-in period, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a &amp;ldquo;waiting room.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provisos&#34;&gt;Provisos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my plan as of August 10th, 2020. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Blackboard regularly. I appreciate everyone&amp;rsquo;s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.&lt;/p&gt;
