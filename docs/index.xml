      <title>COVID-19 Pandemic - Plans for Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe, but we&amp;rsquo;re facing our fourth semester dramatically altered by our public health situation. In early May, it felt like this fall might be &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; - widespread vaccination at SLU would mean we could have class, go to the dining hall, go to Chaifetz Arena, and hang out with friends like SLU students were able to do in the fall of 2019. The last three months in Missouri and elsewhere in the United States have shown us that we cannot expect a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; semester. We simultaneously have more risk (in the form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus&amp;rsquo;s Delta variant, which spreads more efficiently than other forms of SARS-CoV-2) and more hope (almost everyone on campus is vaccinated and boosters are on the way for the most vulnerable members of our community).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this raises more novel questions for us to confront. Will indoor mask requirements be relaxed at any point before December? When will we be able to get booster shots? What happens if we get a breakthrough case? If this is your first semester at SLU, you probably have even more questions about starting at a new institution in the middle of a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, I think we&amp;rsquo;re starting this semester in an even more challenging position. As I write this, it&amp;rsquo;s been over seventeen months now since we began practicing physical distancing and limiting activities in places outside of our home. Speaking for myself, I think I&amp;rsquo;m more tired than I&amp;rsquo;ve been. Each month that passes means I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time without seeing friends the way I used to see them, more time worrying, and more time holding off on doing things I love like traveling. On top of that, I am doing something I haven&amp;rsquo;t done since March 2020 - go back into a physical classroom. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m nervous about this, especially because my daughter is not vaccinated and I would be crushed if I got her sick. For these reasons, I&amp;rsquo;m anticipating that this will be the most difficult semester yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the fall of 1919 had similar questions and concerns. I think it is worth remembering, though, that SLU turned 100 years old the year that pandemic started. Despite the 1918 flu pandemic, we&amp;rsquo;re still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we&amp;rsquo;ll get through this, just like SLU&amp;rsquo;s graduating classes in the early 1920s did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our &amp;ldquo;new normal.&amp;rdquo; I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your Fall semesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;focusing-on-what-matters&#34;&gt;Focusing on What Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we&amp;rsquo;ll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we have stayed health and have been able to see our families several times. We are lucky in that respect. For some of you, you may have experienced quarantining because you were exposed to someone who was ill. Perhaps you even became ill yourselves. All of this likely increases the stress of this semester - I know many of my students are anxious to avoid quarantine housing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, we have new concerns, like being back in St. Louis away from our families again, and what 2021 will bring with new variants of COVID, breakthrough cases, and booster shots. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of this takes precedence over a semester&amp;rsquo;s worth of college classes.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are &amp;ldquo;normal.&amp;rdquo; We can&amp;rsquo;t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it&amp;rsquo;s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice-self-care&#34;&gt;Practice Self Care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - mostly running outdoors when it is nice and cycling indoors when the weather isn&amp;rsquo;t great. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I&amp;rsquo;m home. I try to make time to read for pleasure. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/slu.edu/covid-19fall2020preparationmod/home/part-four-encouragement-and-support&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2020 Return to Campus Module&lt;/a&gt; provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-class-be-like&#34;&gt;What Will Class Be Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details about assignments and readings are available in the syllabi for &lt;a href = &#34;https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus-alt/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Section 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href = &#34;https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Section 5&lt;/a&gt;, but I wanted to give you all a quick preview of what the class materials will be like. Readings for the semester will come from one of three places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I am using a website called &lt;a href = &#34;https://www.sociologyexperiment.com&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A Sociology Experiment&lt;/a&gt; instead of a regular text book. Chapters are written by leading sociologists, and cost $1 each. You&amp;rsquo;ll only pay for the chapters you need. I know that the pandemic has created financial uncertainty for many of us, and providing you excellent resources for the lowest cost possible is important to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to purchase a copy of &lt;a href = &#34;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo37936174.html&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mama Might Be Better Off Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which retails for around $20 and is available at all the usual places you can buy books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also share some readings and documentaries that you can access for free using the Library, even if you are off-campus for some of the semester.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Canvas to access my slides and notes for each lecture, submit assignments, and take one of the three quizzes that will happen this semester. You&amp;rsquo;ll take these outside of class, and have a 15 hour period of time to take each of them (from 7:00 AM CST until 10:00 PM CST). Once you start, you&amp;rsquo;ll have 45 minutes to complete the 30 multiple choice questions. These quizzes aren&amp;rsquo;t cumulative, and make up just over 25% of your final grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of your points this semester will therefore come from some short assignments that ask you to reflect on how sociological concepts have shaped your life (&amp;ldquo;Sociological Experiences&amp;rdquo;), create research questions based on social theory (&amp;ldquo;Theory Isn&amp;rsquo;t Dead Posts&amp;rdquo;), and reflect on the content of &lt;em&gt;Mama Might Be Better Off Dead&lt;/em&gt;. Rubrics and examples will be shared via our Canvas site for each of these assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also expect that you will come to class. I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking attendance, which is something I have always done, but it has added weight this semester. To facilitate contact tracing efforts, we need to know who is attending class each day. Moreover, we need to know where each of you are sitting. So, not only will you need to sign in to class each day, but I will need you to sit in the same seat for each class meeting. On the first day of class, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sending out a form to help create our seating chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syllabus contains all the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes not just because of contact tracing needs but also so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can&amp;rsquo;t attend classes occasionally, no worries. I&amp;rsquo;ll work with you to get you a recording of the class (most likely from a prior semester). That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. There will be a participation grade (just over 16% of your final grade) that reflects these interactive aspects of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-if-i-get-sick&#34;&gt;What Happens If I Get Sick?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you&amp;rsquo;re sick but not &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I will ask, that even if you think it is &amp;ldquo;just a cold,&amp;rdquo; you do not come to class and let Student Health know so that you can get a COVID-19 test. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to move into quarantine housing, I will make sure you have a recording of my lecture (most likely from a prior semester) and any other resources you need to stay current with course work. I can also arrange for students in quarantine housing to Zoom into class on an as-needed basis - we&amp;rsquo;ll cross that bridge if we have to! My point is - no matter what happens this semester to you, my goal is to make it as successful an academic experience as it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-if-we-have-to-go-remote&#34;&gt;What Happens if We Have to Go Remote?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (a) I cannot come to campus because I need to quarantine or (b) SLU switches to remote instruction either temporarily or for the remainder of the semester, we will move our entire course onto Zoom. In the case of an extended move to remote learning where students have to move out of campus housing, I have two &amp;ldquo;flex&amp;rdquo; days built into the syllabus so that we can reshuffle our schedule as needed. I have taught on Zoom for two and a half semesters now, and this course is designed to work in either face to face or remote settings with little change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About those &amp;ldquo;flex days&amp;rdquo; - if we don&amp;rsquo;t need them (and I really hope we don&amp;rsquo;t!), they will become days off for you all. I won&amp;rsquo;t try to cram extra material in to the syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-office-hours-be-like&#34;&gt;What Will Office Hours Be Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My office hours are for you! I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you&amp;rsquo;ve never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike class, office hours will occur over Zoom. To help me manage, they are available by appointment only from 9am until 10:30am.
You will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provisos&#34;&gt;Provisos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my plan as of August 20th, 2021. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Canvas regularly. I appreciate everyone&amp;rsquo;s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to

      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/module-3-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;confederate-monuments&#34;&gt;Confederate Monuments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we discussed about monuments to the Confederacy comes from a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splcenter.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center&lt;/a&gt; report on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Confederate Monuments&lt;/a&gt;. An updated version of the image on the slides is also available 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/com_whose_heritage_timeline_print.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;in the report&lt;/a&gt;. Among these are the schools I mentioned that are memorials to Confederate officers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 103 public schools and three colleges named for Confederates leaders, those honoring Robert E. Lee are the most numerous (42), followed by Stonewall Jackson (15), Jefferson Davis (11), Nathan Bedford Forrest (8), P.G.T. Beauregard (7) and John Reagan (6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned the ties between 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee_Day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Robert E. Lee Day&lt;/a&gt;. The same 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center report&lt;/a&gt; discusses these holidays that mark aspects of the Confederacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nine holidays officially observed in 2018 are: Alabama (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davisâ Birthday); Mississippi (Robert E. Lee Day, Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davisâ Birthday); South Carolina (Confederate Memorial Day); Texas (Confederate Heroesâ Day); Virginia (Lee-Jackson Day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other states that have Confederate holidays in their state codes are Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking these holidays and the Civil War more generally as a war about &amp;ldquo;states&#39; rights&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;northern aggression&amp;rdquo; is a cultural holdover from the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lost Cause&amp;rdquo; myth&lt;/a&gt;. In DeKalb County, Georgia, officials have now installed a plaque next to an existing Confederate monument that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ajc.com/news/local/marker-supplies-historical-context-for-dekalb-confederate-monument/3mGyZ6ITzCEGVgz785O1zJ/?fbclid=IwAR0iRmJHE3WtLX7J17OJ6bcAplgrcn9eROfsmUCavlBsxp7fex-moAizXMw#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;provides context about the &amp;ldquo;lost cause&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way in which these stories get 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reify&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reified&lt;/a&gt; is through secondary school education that highlights certain themes at the expense of others. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/12/us/texas-vs-california-history-textbooks.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recently compared&lt;/a&gt; two history textbooks from California and Texas to give readers a sense of how these books differ in the way they present history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;latino-health-paradox&#34;&gt;Latino Health Paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Latino immigrants

&lt;p&gt;We briefly mentioned the following people:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;division-of-labor&#34;&gt;Division of Labor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a concept 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89mile_Durkheim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ãmile Durkheim&lt;/a&gt; raised in his 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Division_of_Labour_in_Society&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;doctoral dissertation&lt;/a&gt;, in which he argued that capitalism had fundamentally altered how societies were organized. He described cohesion in pre-capitalist societies as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_and_organic_solidarity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mechanical solidarity&lt;/a&gt;, in which social ties bound more homogeneous groups of individuals together. With the advent of advanced capitalism, Durkheim argued that societies had shifted to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_and_organic_solidarity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;organic solidarity&lt;/a&gt;, in which a division of labor bound more heterogeneous groups of people together. These ideas are similar to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_T%c3%b6nnies&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; ideas of

Gemeinschaft offers a parallel to Durkheim&amp;rsquo;s idea of mechanical solidarity, while Gesellschaft parallels organic solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meeting-03 - Theorizing Health Disparities</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/module-1-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/module-1-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;interventions&#34;&gt;Interventions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the models we discussed today focused on how to intervene to address health disparities. The &amp;ldquo;Health Impact Pyramid&amp;rdquo; was proposed by Thomas Frieden, MD in 2010 in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2009.185652&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Public Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;middle-range-theory&#34;&gt;Middle Range Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &amp;ldquo;grand&amp;rdquo; theories that start with a theoretical idea and attempt to explain a large number of phenomena, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-range_theory_%28sociology%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;mid-&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;middle-range theory&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; attempts to address a concrete and relatively narrow empirical issue. The idea was put forth by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Robert K. Merton, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; (1910-2003), who spent the majority of his career at Columbia University. The original idea was discussed in a 1949 paper called 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Robert%20K%20Merton%20-%20On%20Sociological%20Theories%20of%20the%20Middle%20Range.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;On Sociological Theories of the Middle Range.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;model-for-the-social-determiants-of-health&#34;&gt;Model for the Social Determiants of Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model presented in class was originally published by the National Academy of Sciences in a report called &amp;ldquo;Promoting Health: Intervention Strategies from Social and Behavioral Research.&amp;rdquo; I call it the &amp;ldquo;Kaplan model&amp;rdquo; because it was featured in a 2004 article by a public health professor at the University of Michigan named George Kaplan. That article, titled 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/26/1/124/384238&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whatâs Wrong with Social Epidemiology, and How Can We Make It Better?,&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which discusses the both the strengths and the weakensses of these types of models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slavery-hypertension-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Slavery Hypertension Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed this briefly in class today, but if you want to learn a bit more about the lack of biomedical evidence for this, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-may-17-oe-obasogie17-story.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this LA Times&lt;/a&gt; editorial from 2007 as well as 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Kaufman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the Social Science Research Council. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2003/01000/The_Slavery_Hypertension_Hypothesis__Dissemination.27.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This 2003 article from &lt;em&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides a more detailed breakdown of the problems with the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-people&#34;&gt;Other People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also briefly mentioned the following people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Getting Around SOC 1120</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_around/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_around/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-main-course-resources&#34;&gt;What Are the Main Course Resources?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three big resources that you&amp;rsquo;ll be using this semester to take this class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href = &#34;http://canvas.slu.edu&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Canvas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Canvas for getting access to course materials like slides and notes, finding recordings of lectures, taking quizzes, and making discussion board posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second is our &lt;strong&gt;syllabus,&lt;/strong&gt; which is available for &lt;a href = &#34;https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus-alt/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Section 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href = &#34;https://slu-soc1120.github.io/syllabus/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Section 5&lt;/a&gt;. The syllabus contains all the course policies, due dates, readings, documentary links, and is your user guide to the class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we have this &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://slu-soc1120.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;course website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that includes links to all of these materials as well as a &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo; section (which you&amp;rsquo;re in right now!) that has additional links to videos, news stories, biographies, and other relevant materials. These will help you get the most out of the class! I do this publicly so that I can share these resources between sections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do my best to provide links between these difference sources as often as possible. However, I recommend bookmarking the course website, which includes links to everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-the-course-organized&#34;&gt;How Is the Course Organized?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course is organized into four parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking Like Sociologists - an introduction to the discipline of sociology, social theory, social science research methods, and the basics of what we call &amp;ldquo;social structure&amp;rdquo; - the way societies are organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Blocks of Society - an introduction to the key aspects of society, including culture, socioeconomic status, and gender and sexuality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Broken Heart of America - an overview of race and ethnicity in the United States, intersectionality theory, and urban social problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course Conclusion - wrapping up the semester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Part has at least two &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; - collections of lectures, readings, documentaries, and assignments. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the left-hand menu bar on Canvas as well as in the course docs on the website are both organized by these modules. They&amp;rsquo;ll be released one at a time as we go through the semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-stay-up-to-date&#34;&gt;How Do I Stay Up-to-date?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, come to class. I start every class with &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo; that includes announcements and upcoming deadlines. I also end class with &amp;ldquo;back matter,&amp;rdquo; which reviews some of the most important announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also use Canvas&amp;rsquo;s Announcements page to send you emails about class. This means you &lt;em&gt;need to check your email regularly.&lt;/em&gt; This means every day, multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So You Need a Letter of Recommendation?</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_letters/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_letters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Letters of recommendation, or references more generally, are an important part of many internship, job, and graduate school applications. For this class in particular, I get &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of requests for pre-med evaluations as part of the committee process, particularly for students who are in the Medical Scholars program. As faculty, we get requests every semester from students to (ideally) sing their praises. So, we expect you to ask! However, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that students are sometimes unsure both &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; to ask and &lt;em&gt;how to ask&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-to-ask&#34;&gt;Who to Ask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask professors who know you well and will have a lot to say about you.&lt;/strong&gt; For me, this means I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to get to know you outside of class. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never spoken up in class, come to office hours, or otherwise had some kind of interaction with me, it is nearly impossible for me to write a convincing, comprehensive letter of recommendation. This means you need to &lt;em&gt;think ahead&lt;/em&gt;! Don&amp;rsquo;t wait until you need a letter from me to swing by my office - start building that relationship well ahead of time so that, when it comes time to ask for the favor of a letter (and it will come time!), I am able to enthusiastically say &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letters are easiest to write for students who I have had in more than one class. So, if you&amp;rsquo;ve only known me briefly and in a limited way, you should consider asking a faculty member who knows you better. Similarly, if you did not do well in the only class you&amp;rsquo;ve had with me, you are better off asking another faculty member who can speak to your strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; is to think of faculty as being specialists. I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; write a letter of recommendation on your behalf for admission to a doctoral program in chemistry, but do you really want me to? My letter will not carry the weight that a letter would from a faculty member in chemistry or an allied discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions I suggest students ask themselves before approaching faculty are therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How well does the professor know me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which of my strengths can they speak to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can they uniquely speak to something related to this job/internship/graduate school application?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure if I am the best fit or not, swing by my office to ask! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to entertain informal requests and talk with you about the letter writing process ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-ask&#34;&gt;How to Ask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, &lt;strong&gt;ask&lt;/strong&gt;! Nothing is more frustrating with this process than being cold-called by a colleague, an HR staff member, or by a supervisor asking for a recommendation that I am not prepared to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you ask, &lt;strong&gt;ask well ahead of time&lt;/strong&gt;. This is less important if I am only serving as a reference and will not be required to write a letter on your behalf. I need, typically, at least &lt;strong&gt;two weeks notice&lt;/strong&gt; before a submission deadline for a student who I have not written a letter for previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you approach me, make sure you &lt;strong&gt;have everything I will need&lt;/strong&gt; in hand. This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a description of the position you are applying for,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few ideas of things you want me to emphasize in my letter,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an updated resume,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and instructions on how I should submit your letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are asking me to provide letters for more than one or two jobs, internships, or schools, please also provide a &lt;strong&gt;Google sheet&lt;/strong&gt; that breaks down each position by deadline so that I can make sure all of the letters get to their destinations on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have all of your materials together, please &lt;strong&gt;come see me in person&lt;/strong&gt; instead of just emailing me. This will allow me the chance to ask you questions about the position and make sure I have everything that I need to write the best letter possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-i-say-no&#34;&gt;If I Say &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be forewarned that &lt;strong&gt;I might say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; to a request&lt;/strong&gt; if I do not feel like I can write you a positive or comprehensive letter. This may be because you have not done well in my classes, or because I don&amp;rsquo;t know you well outside of class. This is particularly true for my larger classes like Introduction to Sociology, where I do not get a chance to know many students outside of the classroom. This goes back to my earlier advice - make sure you are asking faculty who know you well and who can speak to your strengths! I also might say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo; if I am not given sufficient lead time, so please heed my advice about asking for a letter early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I say &amp;lsquo;no&amp;rsquo;, please do not take it personally. I get multiple requests for recommendations and letters each semester, and I need to prioritize students that I am best positioned to write about. If I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like that is you, I&amp;rsquo;ll be more than happy to help you brainstorm about who might be best to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;following-up&#34;&gt;Following Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve asked, and I&amp;rsquo;ve said &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;, &lt;strong&gt;please follow-up as deadlines approach&lt;/strong&gt;. I do my best to get letters in before deadlines, and will reach out as I submit letters on your behalf to let you know about my progress. However, it is in your best interest to reach out if you have not heard from me and a deadline is approaching. Please don&amp;rsquo;t feel shy about reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you get one of the positions I&amp;rsquo;ve written a letter for, &lt;strong&gt;let me know&lt;/strong&gt;! It is always gratifying to hear about your successes, so please reach out with the good news!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Office Hours are Really Student Hours</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_office-hours/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_office-hours/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my experience, we don&amp;rsquo;t do a great job communicating to students about what office hours are for and when you should come to them. So, if you&amp;rsquo;ve had questions about what office hours are or when to come, you are not alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-office-hours-are&#34;&gt;What Office Hours Are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start with what I think we (professors) think is obvious but in practice is not always - office hours are &lt;strong&gt;for you&lt;/strong&gt;! This is time we reserve each week for students to drop by, get help, or just catch up. I may spend the time doing work if I&amp;rsquo;m not meeting with students, but its work I am happy (and able) to stop if you want to chat. So, if you come to my office (or to the lab where I sometimes hold office hours), you are definitely not interrupting. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;strong&gt;rather&lt;/strong&gt; talk to you then do work. Getting to know students is part of my job, and one that I particularly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-to-come&#34;&gt;When to Come&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most students are not a weekly presence at office hours, so the next real question is when you should come. To some degree this depends on your goal. If you want to stop by and talk about a specific assignment or grade, it helps to come as soon as you&amp;rsquo;ve received your grade. If you want to talk about 
&lt;a href=&#34;docs/resources_quizzes/&#34;&gt;studying for quizzes&lt;/a&gt;, try to come a couple of weeks before an quiz rather than right before it - that will give you time to alter any study practices based on our conversation. The same is true if you want to proactively address an assignment - don&amp;rsquo;t come right before it is due, but rather a couple weeks out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-ok-to-just-chat&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s OK to Just Chat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need an excuse to come to office hours beyond wanting to talk, though. Getting to know faculty is important, even when you are a first year student. We can help you pick classes, think about study abroad, find internships, or just talk about survival strategies if that is what you need. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need us for some of those things - letters of recommendation are sometimes needed for study abroad, and often needed for things like internships, graduate school, and medical school. It is much, much harder to write letters that are convincing and compelling if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the student well, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;docs/resources_letters/&#34;&gt;I may say no to students if I don&amp;rsquo;t know them outside of the classroom&lt;/a&gt;. Lay the foundation for this early - come back and check in - you don&amp;rsquo;t need to stay long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;they-arent-just-for-current-students&#34;&gt;They Aren&amp;rsquo;t Just for Current Students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also don&amp;rsquo;t have to be in a class with me that semester to come by - I love catching up with students from previous semesters. Come back and tell me how your semester abroad, your summer touring with the Dead, or your sweet data science internship turned out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-office-hours&#34;&gt;Virtual Office Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2021-2022 academic year,  appointments are available for an hour and a half each week from 9am CST to 10:30am CST on Wednesdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my &lt;a href = &#34;https://calendly.com/chris-prener&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Calendly page&lt;/a&gt;. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you&amp;rsquo;ll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I&amp;rsquo;ll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Other Tips</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_other/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;attendance&#34;&gt;Attendance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the syllabus notes, this course does have an attendance policy. At the beginning of class, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask everyone to scan a &lt;a href = &#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;QR code&lt;/a&gt; that I post on-screen. You&amp;rsquo;ll need a smartphone or a tablet with a camera to do this. Here are some instructions for devices that run &lt;a href = &#34;https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-ios/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href = &#34;https://www.qr-code-generator.com/guides/scan-qr-code-android/&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Android&lt;/a&gt; operating systems. If you do not have a QR code reader built-in to your operating system, you will need to download a free third party application from your app store. &lt;strong&gt;If you do not have access to a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Studying for Quizzes</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_quizzes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_quizzes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of questions, particularly from first year students, about the best ways to study for my exams. Here are some general thoughts on maximizing your changes for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-everything-together&#34;&gt;Get Everything Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I give advice, I assume that students have been taking notes on the readings, lectures, and documentaries. I think this is the single best things you can do to maximize your chances for success on my exams. When it is time to start studying, I recommend &lt;em&gt;synthesizing&lt;/em&gt; everything. That is, taking all of your notes on a particular topic (like &amp;ldquo;Culture&amp;rdquo;) and combining them together into a single study guide for each major heading on the syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on major headings and keywords from chapters and lectures, as well as the names that show up in readings and during class. The highest probability questions come from topics that appear in both the readings and the lectures, though I&amp;rsquo;ll pull a few questions from the lectures that weren&amp;rsquo;t part of a reading and vice versa. I tend to create exams that provide pretty even coverage of the lectures within each section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;studying-for-multiple-choice-questions&#34;&gt;Studying for Multiple Choice Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple choice questions tend to revolve around demonstrating that you know the definition of key terms or can reverse the process and identify a key term if given the definition. I sometimes test names of important sociologists directly - &amp;ldquo;which classical theorist is associated with theories related to organizations and bureaucracy?&amp;rdquo; (A: Weber). Other times I use the name as a hint or a clue regarding the correct answer. Other times I test both of these things by providing a scenario - &amp;ldquo;this particular person has been in the news - their leadership style is best represented by which of these Weberian ideal-types?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to make sure you know, therefore, the main ideas expressed in each major topic of the course, the people that go along with them, the social theories we discuss, and the substance of really critical pieces of evidence (I might ask, for example, about the essential details from a documentary, case study, or illustrative example we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed in class). Often, questions related to this final point are pretty general and if you read between the lines, you can zero in on the correct answer if you think about the major themes at play even if you can&amp;rsquo;t remember the specific example the question asks about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-course-docs-fit-in&#34;&gt;How do Course Docs fit in?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the Fall 2019 semester, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun posting materials here in the Course Docs. These are experimental, and will not necessarily be available for all weeks of my intro course. The intent of these is not to re-hash or cover course material, but rather to take you &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; if you &lt;em&gt;want to learn more&lt;/em&gt;. This means I &lt;strong&gt;will not be directly testing&lt;/strong&gt; the content of these pages. However, reading through them and using them as a jumping off point will help you learn the course material in a more thorough way. You should absolutely be able to be successful without them, of course, but you will be more confident in your mastery of the course material itself with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quiz-day&#34;&gt;Quiz Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this course, quizzes happen via Canvas. They&amp;rsquo;re all multiple choice, and you can start the quiz at any time between 7:00AM CST and 10:00PM CST. Once you start the quiz, you have forty-five minutes to answer thirty questions. Since you&amp;rsquo;re not taking this in the classroom, it would be silly to try and tell you not to use outside resources. That said, you don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of time for the quiz. Get yourself organized - if you&amp;rsquo;ve studied and worked on those guides that I describe above, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have a much easier time taking the quiz. Conversely, if you try to Google your way through the quiz or rummage through class and reading notes, it is going to be a tough quiz to finish. Please do not close your computer, let it go to sleep, or let it get disconnected from the internet. If you run into technical issues with Canvas, or get disconnected from the quiz, please email me right away. However, because I cannot be equally available and responsive during the fifteen hour period when the quiz is open, I cannot answer substantive questions over email.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing the Little Things Right</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_little-things/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_little-things/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Settling into college can be daunting - there are a host of new relationships to navigate (roommates, advisers, faculty) and a whole new set of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;social and cultural norms&lt;/a&gt; to follow and occasionally break. Below are some tips for surviving in this brave new world you&amp;rsquo;ve found yourself in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-call-us&#34;&gt;What to Call Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re coming from high school, you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to calling your teachers &amp;ldquo;Mrs.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Mr.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Miss.&amp;rdquo;. This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the approach you should take with professors. Universities have an elaborate 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labour&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;division of labor&lt;/a&gt;, and faculty often (but not always) have doctorates. The honorifics we use reflect this, and you want to make sure you get this right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always, always, always call faculty you haven&amp;rsquo;t met before &amp;ldquo;Doctor&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Professor.&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure if your professor has a doctorate or not, feel free to use &amp;ldquo;Professor.&amp;rdquo; Better to over-assume their credentials and have them correct you than the opposite. If  you&amp;rsquo;re cold calling or emailing someone, assume that they prefer to use &amp;ldquo;Doctor&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Professor.&amp;rdquo; The same is true if faculty do not tell you what to call them on the first day of class - it is better to be overly polite than it is to take an informal approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look for clues in how we sign our emails. If a professor signs with their first name, this is typically invitation to respond using their first name as well. If a professor signs their emails with initials, it&amp;rsquo;s best to stick with &amp;ldquo;Doctor&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Professor&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;Dr.&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;Prof&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some professors are OK with students using their first name (I let my students call me Chris, for example). However, even if a professor says it is OK to use their first name, it is also totally fine to continue to use honorifics with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can all seem a bit petty, but it&amp;rsquo;s an important exercise in acknowledging the division of labor you&amp;rsquo;re a part of. This is especially true for faculty from groups typically underrepresented in academia (women in many disciplines, and faculty from racial and ethnic minority groups). Their expertise is unfortunately questioned or ignored, and using honorifics signals that you acknowledge that expertise in a small but meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-emails&#34;&gt;Writing Emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the interactions you&amp;rsquo;ll have with faculty are going to be over email, so it is worth taking just a bit of time to put some thought into how you do that. First, always use your university email account. This will clearly identify who you are in a way that a gmail account may not (&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:skibum02@gmail.com&#34;&gt;skibum02@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, for example). Second, when you start the email, make sure you get the honorific right (see above) and make sure you spell our names correctly. Beyond that, I love the tips in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@lportwoodstacer/how-to-email-your-professor-without-being-annoying-af-cf64ae0e4087&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this fantastic medium post&lt;/a&gt; for putting together an effective email to professors (or really anyone) - follow them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re on the subject, it is also important to remember that this is the way the University and faculty are going to communicate with you. You need to check your email daily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;show-us-the-love&#34;&gt;Show Us the Love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re humans, too (I swear), and that means we have egos, sensitivities, and even feelings from time to time. While deep down we know that you have multiple priorities and our class may not always be at the top of your list, you also don&amp;rsquo;t need to rub it in. In particular, you want to avoid telegraphing to professors that you are only taking the class for a requirement, or because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet on Fridays (a game I played in college). There are some professors who might be OK with hearing this, but I&amp;rsquo;d say we&amp;rsquo;re in the minority and it is better to assume that it won&amp;rsquo;t be taken well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;remember-there-are-many-of-you&#34;&gt;Remember There Are Many of You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you will have somewhere between four and six professors each semester. In contrast, I typically have 50-100 students in a given semester here at SLU. I find that students often either (a) forgot that this imbalance exists or (b) assume that because this imbalance exists, we don&amp;rsquo;t have time. Nothing could be further from the truth - we&amp;rsquo;ll always make time for your email or meeting, but just need you to remember the imbalance and be patient with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that students often don&amp;rsquo;t understand is that teaching is only part of our job. We also are expected to be actively engaged with research and writing during the semester, and be involved with what we call service (typically helping our Department, College, or discipline run). Again, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to help or don&amp;rsquo;t want to help, but that we may not be at our desk every day or have availability certain times of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-through-but-admit-when-you-cant&#34;&gt;Follow Through, But Admit When You Can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of showing us the love is following through. If you say you&amp;rsquo;re going to come to office hours, come! If you volunteer to help with some research, make sure you fulfill your end of the arrangement you make with us. If you cannot follow through, a quick email saying something came up goes a long way. Students sometimes drop off the radar, and its much better to be upfront with us about whatever change or challenge has come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-yourself-organized&#34;&gt;Keep Yourself Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management is a skill that I see a lot of students struggle with (and that I struggled with in college). 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://students.dartmouth.edu/academic-skills/learning-resources/time-management-&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt; has a great set of resources for managing yourself, getting and staying organized, and using a calendar. This is especially important because most professors will tell you that they&amp;rsquo;re going to treat you like an adult - our job isn&amp;rsquo;t to nag you, make you come to class, or check in constantly. This is a bit different than the role that teachers in high school fulfill. If you decide you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do an assignment, or come to class, ultimately we&amp;rsquo;ll let you make those decisions and we&amp;rsquo;ll expect you to understand that there may be consequences (typically in the form of grades that cannot be revised or changed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, keeping yourself organized is critical to being successful! Whatever you do does not need to be elaborate or technologically sophisticated - a pad that you use to write down what you need to accomplish each day and a simple calendar can be enough. The importat thing is to start early with good organization habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communicate-ahead-of-time&#34;&gt;Communicate Ahead of Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest mistakes students make is that they wait until it is too late to ask for help or extensions. Almost all the faculty I know, including myself, would rather have these discussions as soon as you know there is an issue. I will bend over backwards to help students if I can, but I also need to know that there is a need out there that needs to be addressed. This is particularly important because of what I said above about there being many of you - sometimes we need a day or two to follow-up, and so communicating ahead of time helps us help you just a bit more effectively and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-care-of-yourself&#34;&gt;Take Care of Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of you, this is your first time out on your own. We&amp;rsquo;re all going to treat you like an adult. When we say that in this context, we mean that if you want to stay up all night, only eat ice cream, and nap during the afternoon, we&amp;rsquo;re not going to stand in your way. While it is fun to exercise some new forms of autonomy, it can also be easy to get sucked into habits that ultimately are destructive. Similarly, it can be easy to float or disengage from things like school work. While you should absolutely have fun, cut loose, and enjoy being out on your own, you should also start working now on self care and stress management. You will need these skills to be successful here, and you will have a lot more fun if you are not constantly under the burdens of stress, anxiety, or depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ask-for-help&#34;&gt;Ask for Help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure exactly how to deal with stress, depression, anxiety, or another problem, please ask us for help (we&amp;rsquo;ve been there, trust me). If you need immediate help, SLU&amp;rsquo;s

      <title>Tips for Using Canvas</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_canvas/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_canvas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-canvas&#34;&gt;What is Canvas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas&lt;/strong&gt; is what we call a &amp;ldquo;learning management system.&amp;rdquo; It provides a platform for online teaching, and we use it for face-to-face courses as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-use-canvas&#34;&gt;How Do I Use Canvas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href = &#34;http://canvas.slu.edu&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the SLU Canvas login page&lt;/a&gt;. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials when you login. On the landing page, look for TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-around-canvas&#34;&gt;Getting Around Canvas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;netiquette-considerations&#34;&gt;Netiquette Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netiquette is a set of cultural norms (we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss these this semester!) for interacting with classmates online. Different professors might have slightly different ideas about what is appropriate, so don&amp;rsquo;t assume that everything below applies to all classes. These are adapted from &lt;a href=&#34;https://tilt.colostate.edu/TipsAndGuides/Tip/128&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Colorado State&amp;rsquo;s guide to online discussions&lt;/a&gt; and also include some of SLU&amp;rsquo;s best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Not all of these apply to how we&amp;rsquo;ll be using Canvas for this course, but they&amp;rsquo;re solid best practices to follow and so I like to share them anyway!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report Glitches&lt;/strong&gt;: Like all software, sometimes Canvas doesn&amp;rsquo;t work right. If for any reason you experience difficulty participating, please call, email, or otherwise inform me of the issue. Chances are others are having the same problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help Others&lt;/strong&gt;: You may have more experience with online discussion forums than the person next to you. Give them a hand. Show them itâs not so hard. Theyâre really going to appreciate it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Patient&lt;/strong&gt;: Read everything in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something someone else has already contributed. Acknowledge the points made with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you donât.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Brief&lt;/strong&gt;: You want to be clearâand to articulate your pointâwithout being preachy or pompous. Be direct. Stay on point. Donât lose yourself, or your readers, in overly wordy sentences or paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write Well&lt;/strong&gt;: Feel free to be a bit less formal than you would in a paper (contractions are fine), but make sure your work is easy to read. This means correct spelling, grammatical construction and sentence structure are expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cite Your Sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Another big must! If your contribution to the conversation includes the intellectual property (authored material) of others, e.g., books, newspaper, magazine, or journal articlesâonline or in printâthey must be given proper attribution. Use hyperlinks to reference anything online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emojis&lt;/strong&gt;: I differ from many of my colleagues here. Use them if you want!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Diversity&lt;/strong&gt;: Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor.  Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the classâ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc.  Consider the diversity you can see or know â as well as that you cannot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember We Can&amp;rsquo;t See You&lt;/strong&gt;: Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm; without the context of facial expressions or other body language, your tone or intent could be missed or misunderstood by others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect Others&#39; Time&lt;/strong&gt;: Respect othersâ time and life circumstances, which often donât allow for an immediate response to a question or comment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Yelling&lt;/strong&gt;: Step carefully. Beware the electronic footprint you leave behind. Using bold upper-case letters is bad form, like stomping around and yelling at somebody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Flaming&lt;/strong&gt;: Criticism must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. Please, no tantrums. Rants directed at any other contributor are simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The same goes for profanity. The academic environment expects higher-order language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, You Can&amp;rsquo;t Un-Ring the Bell&lt;/strong&gt;: Language is your only tool in an online environment. Be mindful. How others perceive you will be largelyâas alwaysâup to you. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve hit the send button, you&amp;rsquo;ve rung the bell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review and Revise&lt;/strong&gt;: Review your written posts and responses to ensure that youâve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice your proofreading, revision, and rewriting skillsâvaluable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing. I try read my posts out loud. This helps me ensure that grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and my post is clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Tips for Using Zoom</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_zoom/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/start_zoom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Some of these instructions are written for and retained in case we have to move to teaching remotely. Give them a quick read anyway, because some parts will apply to office hours even if we are meeting face to face.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zoom&#34;&gt;What is Zoom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom&lt;/strong&gt; is video conferencing software that we&amp;rsquo;ll be using this semester for class meetings and office hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-access-zoom&#34;&gt;How Do I Access Zoom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links to both will be provided through our course Blackboard site. If you have your own Zoom account that is separate from your SLU account, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; use your SLU account. Our Zoom meetings require this. Please make sure you sign-out of your personal Zoom account before trying to access course meetings and office hours. I strongly encourage you to access our class meetings via a laptop or desktop computer. You should download the &lt;a href = &#34;https://zoom.us/download&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Zoom Client for Meetings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials, so give yourself time before class or an office hours appointment starts. If you need to access Zoom another way, such as calling in, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-login-to-zoom&#34;&gt;How Do I Login to Zoom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to facilitate small-group discussions during class, it is important that you are signed into Zoom via SLU. In-order to ensure that you are signed-in correctly, follow the instructions below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-zoom-via-the-web&#34;&gt;Access Zoom via the Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href = &#34;http://zoom.us&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zoom&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt; and make sure you are signed out of any account you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href = &#34;https://myslu.slu.edu&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mySLU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;Tools&lt;/code&gt; and then click-on &lt;code&gt;Zoom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-zoom-via-an-app&#34;&gt;Access Zoom via an App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your app and sign-out of any account you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose &lt;code&gt;Sign In with SSO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;slu&lt;/code&gt; for the company domain so that it reads &lt;code&gt;slu.zoom.us&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be taken to mySLU and my need to sign-in using your mySLU username and password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-use-zoom&#34;&gt;How Do I Use Zoom?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, using Zoom is pretty straightforward once you&amp;rsquo;ve become used it. There are only a few controls you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know how to use. The most important are how to &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/200941109-Attendee-controls-in-a-meeting&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;turn your audio and video on and off&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-feedback-during-meetings&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;nonverbal feedback&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; sometimes - these options include raising your hand, saying &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;, and an option to ask me to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203650445-In-meeting-chat&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;chat feature&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ll be using. When it, though, remember that your course-related communications to the instructor or other students should be considered âprofessionalâ (they are not like texts to your friends).  Zoom records chats and I can view them, so please keep that in mind as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-best-way-to-arrange-my-zoom-meeting&#34;&gt;What is the Best Way to Arrange my Zoom Meeting?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend that you use Zoom&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href = &#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004802843-Side-by-side-Mode-for-screen-sharing&#34; target = &#34;_blank&#34;&gt;side-by-side mode&lt;/a&gt; for screen sharing. When you are in side-by-side mode, choosing &amp;ldquo;Speaker View&amp;rdquo; will limit the number of webcams you see to just the person speaking. This arrangement allows you to see both my slides and me at the same time, and can be adjusted with your mouse to make the slides smaller or larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-i-have-to-use-my-microphone&#34;&gt;Do I Have To Use My Microphone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you come to class, please mute your microphone. If I call on you and you&amp;rsquo;ve raised your hand, please remember to un-mute yourself before speaking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-i-have-to-use-my-camera&#34;&gt;Do I Have To Use My Camera?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lectures, you are not required to have your camera on - it is entirely up to you. I personally appreciate seeing a few students&#39; faces while I teach, so if you want to leave your camera on, you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing me a favor! But like I said, it isn&amp;rsquo;t required for lectures. However, when we use the &amp;ldquo;breakout room&amp;rdquo; feature for small group discussions, you are expected to have your camera on. These discussions will occur regularly during class meetings, so please keep that in mind as you get ready and prepare your work space before class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-if-i-am-having-technical-issues&#34;&gt;What If I Am Having Technical Issues?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to email me at &lt;a href = &#34;mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu&#34;&gt;chris.prener@slu.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If it is during class, I may not respond right away. That is why we record course meetings, however. If you find that my video or audio is not working well, please let me know in the chat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-considerations&#34;&gt;Other Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are Saint Louis University&amp;rsquo;s best practices for using Zoom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mute your microphone when you are not speaking.  Remember to âun-muteâ yourself just prior to speaking.  Identify yourself when you begin speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect a few seconds of delay in getting a response from the instructor or another class member to a question; wait before repeating your question or assuming it was not heard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, position your camera such that your video feed does not capture too much of your surroundings or other activity/sound from your home/location.  Be conscious of posters, art, or other surroundings that others might find offensive or inappropriate for an educational context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the âRaise Handâ and âChatâ (or similar) features of.  This limits verbal interruptions and the confusion generated when multiple people try to speak at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as in an on-ground, face-to-face class, limit side conversations, multi-tasking (on your computer or otherwise), and use of your cellphone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporarily turn off your video feed and mute your microphone when engaged in any non-class conversation or activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor.  Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the classâ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc.  Consider the diversity you can see or know â as well as that you cannot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that video-based class sessions (including chat transcripts) may be recorded and retrieved for later viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://slu-soc1120.github.io/docs/resources_writing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have writing assignments in all of my classes (even my methods classes), and there are definitely patterns for where students get things right and wrong when it comes to writing assignments. Here are a couple of tips for maximizing your rate of success when it comes to social science writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-a-plan&#34;&gt;Make a Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an outline - it can just be a few bullet points on a sheet of paper to start. Particularly for students coming from the world of lab sciences, where lab notes have structure to them, even a short writing assignment where you open up a blank document can be daunting. So don&amp;rsquo;t open up that blank document without a plan! Start with bullet points, then add in main ideas and supporting evidence. Work yourself towards a paragraph by paragraph or (for longer assignments) a section by section plan for approaching writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;include-a-road-map-in-your-intro&#34;&gt;Include a Road-map in Your Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introductions are hard to write, and some folks recommend that you write it at the end so that you can convincingly lay out what you actually did (as opposed to what you thought you&amp;rsquo;d do but didn&amp;rsquo;t end up doing). No matter when you write it, make sure you have a clear road-map for your paper - tell your audience (so, me!) what you intend to &lt;strong&gt;show&lt;/strong&gt; in your paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-an-argument&#34;&gt;Have An Argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place introductions go awry is that they don&amp;rsquo;t actually take a stand. What is the &lt;strong&gt;point&lt;/strong&gt; of your paper? What are you trying to illustrate or convince your audience (so, me!) of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-avoid-hyperbole&#34;&gt;But Avoid Hyperbole&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, having an over-the-top argument is just as bad. It is a good idea to avoid saying things like &amp;ldquo;the most severe problem in America&amp;rdquo; because I will inevitably write back that this might not actually be the case. You want to be a bit circumspect with your language without being unclear - this is a practice that takes time to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-succinct-and-organized&#34;&gt;Be Succinct and Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common thing I see with undergraduate writing is that it can&amp;hellip; ramble. I think that having a plan (see above) can help address this to some degree. One way to avoid this is to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re aggressively using paragraph breaks. Your paragraph should not run for a full page, and your sentences need to be well organized, too (none of us are 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;William Faulkner&lt;/a&gt;, right?!). You want each paragraph to have a point, and want to make sure it is working in the service of your larger argument. Your paragraphs need to &lt;strong&gt;flow&lt;/strong&gt; from one to the other (we call these &amp;ldquo;transitions&amp;rdquo;), and writing good transitions is &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoid-contractions&#34;&gt;Avoid Contractions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common pieces of feedback I give, aside from the need for more paragraph breaks, is to write out &amp;ldquo;do not&amp;rdquo; instead of saying &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; Why? Using contractions can convey an informal sense to your readers, and you want to avoid doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learn-grammar-rules&#34;&gt;Learn Grammar Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, make sure you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;their&amp;rdquo; (but don&amp;rsquo;t worry about &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rsquo;re&amp;rdquo;, because you&amp;rsquo;re avoiding contractions, right?). Here is a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grammarly.com/blog/30-grammar-mistakes-writers-should-avoid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;great rundown&lt;/a&gt; of some common grammar mistakes to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-actively&#34;&gt;Write Actively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors strongly dislike 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grammarly.com/blog/passive-voice/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;writing that uses passive voice&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you work on spotting it in your own work and writing your papers in an active voice as much as you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-do-it-the-night-before&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Do It The Night Before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give yourself time to proofread. Perhaps the night before is sufficient for this if you can come back to it in the morning, but the more time you give yourself for this, the better. I&amp;rsquo;ll even look at work if I&amp;rsquo;ve got enough lead time (at least a week in advance of the due date).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find you struggle with clarity, reading your work out loud can be really helpful. Its awkward, of course, so do it in a space where you&amp;rsquo;re alone (the library probably isn&amp;rsquo;t an ideal place for this exercise). Another strategy that I use for my own work is to use a tool like 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grammarly.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;. It has helped me improve my writing, and I&amp;rsquo;m an enthusiastic supporter of the platform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reward-yourself&#34;&gt;Reward Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is hard, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen all at once. This is another reason not to start the night before. Have a breakthrough or finish a hard section? Go celebrate! Get it all submitted? Celebrate some more! You worked hard and deserve a chance to give yourself a high five or a pint of ice cream. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;

Among his enormous body of work are a number of songs focused on the civil rights era, including &amp;ldquo;

His murder was retribution for Till&amp;rsquo;s alleged assault of a white women named Carolyn Bryant in a store. However, Bryant admitted in a 2008 interview for

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt;, which is commonly associated with hangings but actually refers to any planned extrajudicial (outside of the justice system) killing by a mob or group.

&lt;p&gt;The majority of data for the first &amp;ldquo;parable&amp;rdquo; were obtained via the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&lt;/a&gt; (OECD; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;). There are a total of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oecd.org/about/members-and-partners/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;36 member states&lt;/a&gt;, primarily found in Europe and the Americas; there are no member states in Africa. As a group, they serve as a proxy for the world&amp;rsquo;s most developed economies. None of the so-called BRIC developing economies (Brazi, Russia, India, and China) are a part of it, though Brazil has applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following OECD data were used in this lecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita&#34;&gt;Per capita&lt;/a&gt; health care spending in U.S. dollars, 2018 (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;Infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; (deaths per 1,000 live births), 2018 (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/infant-mortality-rates.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked at a graph of how the probability of an infant dying by their first birthday grows over its first year at a steeper rate in the United States than elsewhere. This graph was originally published on the Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/29/our-infant-mortality-rate-is-a-national-embarrassment/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wonkblog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gross-domestic-product&#34;&gt;Gross Domestic Product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt;, or GDP, is a measure that captures the value of goods and services produced in a particular place at a given time. We can calculate GDPs for states or countries, for example, in a given year. In this class, we&amp;rsquo;ll express GDP in 
&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita&#34;&gt;per capita&lt;/a&gt; terms, so that we know the total dollar value &lt;em&gt;per person&lt;/em&gt; of a given place&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;Infant Mortality Rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of deaths of children that occur prior to their first birthdays, divided by the total number of live births. This is almost always expressed as a 
&lt;a href=&#34;#rates-per-capita&#34;&gt;per capita rate&lt;/a&gt; - the number of deaths per 1,000 live births. The word &amp;ldquo;mortality&amp;rdquo; is used in place of &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; frequently in scientific discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lead-poisoning&#34;&gt;Lead Poisoning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second &amp;ldquo;parable&amp;rdquo; this week had to do with lead poisoning. Lead was commonly

Leaded paint was banned in 1978, lead in pipes in and solder/flux in 1986, and leaded gasoline was finally phased out in 1995, even though

&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-expectancy&#34;&gt;Life Expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we discuss life expectancy, we typically are describing the number of years an infant should expect to live &lt;em&gt;on average&lt;/em&gt;. The caveat is that we expect death rates not to change when we make this calculation, and we do not know cohort-specific death rates in advance. So, a change in history (for example, a war or a pandemic) will dramatically alter the actual life expectancy of particular groups (cohorts) in society. Nevertheless, this is a useful way to compare general levels of population health - healthier, safer societies have higher average life expectancy at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-miscegenation_laws_in_the_United_States&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;anti-miscegenation laws&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;). The Lovings had been charged under this statute in 1958, and subsequently sued Virginia. Their lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Loving v. Virginia&lt;/a&gt; (1968) that these laws violated the U.S. Constitution&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;norman-rockwell&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/a&gt; (1894-1978) was an American painter, known for his generally popular (though often not critically acclaimed) portraits of mid-century American life. His work was featured for nearly fifty years on the covers of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Saturday Evening Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed two of his paintings - 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saying_Grace_%28Rockwell%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saying Grace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1951) and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem We all Live With&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1964), the latter of which captures four U.S. Marshals escorting 
&lt;a href=&#34;#ruby-bridges&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/a&gt; to elementary school in New Orleans during that city&amp;rsquo;s school desegregation crisis. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in Western Massachusetts, you can stop and see the 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nrm.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell Museum&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to preserving his works and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;per-capita-statistics&#34;&gt;Per Capita Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;per capita&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;per person.&amp;rdquo; Calculating statistics on a per capita basis is particularly important, since larger countries should, for example, be expected to spend more in total than smaller countries (an example we looked at this week using 
&lt;a href=&#34;#health-care-spending&#34;&gt;OECD data&lt;/a&gt;). When we calculate something per person, we remove any inherent bias due to total population size. To do this, we divide the value of interest by the total population (i.e. the total health care dollars spent by total population). We may find that larger countries still spend more &lt;em&gt;per person,&lt;/em&gt; but we are only able to make a valid comparison because we&amp;rsquo;ve converted our numbers appropriately. We&amp;rsquo;ll use per capita statistics frequently in this class as we make comparisons across neighborhoods, cities, states, and countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rates&#34;&gt;Rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates are another extremely important statistical concept that we&amp;rsquo;ll use frequently this semester, because they put often very large or very small numbers in greater context. We used rates this week to compare 
&lt;a href=&#34;#health-care-spending&#34;&gt;infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; across countries. A country with a large number of births would also be expected to have a higher number of babies who die before their first birthdays. To compenstate for this, comparisons are made using 
&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt;. To calculate a rate in this case, we divide the total number of deaths by the total number of live births. A rate is always calculated this way, taking the number of occurences and dividing it by total number of possibly affected people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rates-per-capita&#34;&gt;Rates Per Capita&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to compare 
&lt;a href=&#34;#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; across neighborhoods, cities, states, or countries, use utilize 
&lt;a href=&#34;#per-capita-statistics&#34;&gt;per capita statistics&lt;/a&gt;. When we calculate a &amp;ldquo;rate per capita&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;per capita rate,&amp;rdquo; we take our rate and multiply it by a set number of individuals. This helps us ensure that our rates are expressed relative to the size of the population they describe. For example, we typically calculate 
&lt;a href=&#34;#infant-mortality-rate&#34;&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; by multiplying a given entity&amp;rsquo;s rate by 1,000. In the United States, we typically calculate per capita crime rates by taking a city&amp;rsquo;s or state&amp;rsquo;s rate, and multiplying it by 100,000. Like the other statistical calculations discussed this week, we do this because it helps facilitate more valid comparisons between like things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ruby-bridges&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Bridges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ruby Bridges&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1954) was the first African American child to desegregate an all white elementary school in New Orleans. Her daily walk to school with an escort of U.S. Marshalls was memorialized in 
&lt;a href=&#34;#norman-rockwell&#34;&gt;Norman Rockwell&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; 1964 painting 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_We_All_Live_With&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Problem We all Live With&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her attendance at the school was difficult for her and her family - she spent all of the first year and part of the second alone in a classroom with a teacher, and the family suffered a number of consequential setbacks due to their notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stroke-belt&#34;&gt;The Stroke Belt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third parable for this week was about America&amp;rsquo;s stroke belt. The data we saw on the slides came from the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/maps_data.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve shared the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/slu-soc1120/US_OUTCOMES_Stroke&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;maps and the code used to make them&lt;/a&gt;. The academic literature on the stroke belt has expanded in the last few years, led by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/maria.glymour&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Maria Glymour, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at UCSF. She has documented increased risk of stroke on top of pre-existing disparities in stroke risk for both

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.482059&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;born in these states&lt;/a&gt; as well as individuals who

However, there is still quite a bit we don&amp;rsquo;t know about why stroke rates are higher here (and there are some areas within these states where 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012997&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rates are lower&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vietnam-war&#34;&gt;The Vietnam War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long-running conflict, which the U.S. was involved in from November, 1955 through April, 1975. The war itself is a massive and contraverseal topic in the U.S. You can get a brief overview of the conflict

&lt;p&gt;e. &lt;strong&gt;Exceptions and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt; means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f. &lt;strong&gt;Licensed Material&lt;/strong&gt; means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g. &lt;strong&gt;Licensed Rights&lt;/strong&gt; means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;h. &lt;strong&gt;Licensor&lt;/strong&gt; means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. &lt;strong&gt;Share&lt;/strong&gt; means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;j. &lt;strong&gt;Sui Generis Database Rights&lt;/strong&gt; means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k. &lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt; means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-2--scope&#34;&gt;Section 2 â Scope.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;License grant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions and Limitations.&lt;/strong&gt; For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term.&lt;/strong&gt; The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.&lt;/strong&gt; The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downstream recipients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;strong&gt;Offer from the Licensor â Licensed Material.&lt;/strong&gt; Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;strong&gt;No downstream restrictions.&lt;/strong&gt; You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No endorsement.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other rights.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-3--license-conditions&#34;&gt;Section 3 â License Conditions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. a copyright notice;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&amp;rsquo;s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-4--sui-generis-database-rights&#34;&gt;Section 4 â Sui Generis Database Rights.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-5--disclaimer-of-warranties-and-limitation-of-liability&#34;&gt;Section 5 â Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. &lt;strong&gt;Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. &lt;strong&gt;To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-6--term-and-termination&#34;&gt;Section 6 â Term and Termination.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-7--other-terms-and-conditions&#34;&gt;Section 7 â Other Terms and Conditions.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;section-8--interpretation&#34;&gt;Section 8 â Interpretation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in the public domain or where your use is permitted by an applicable exception or limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity, privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.&lt;/p&gt;
